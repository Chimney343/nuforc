"Hovering, shapeshifting object becomes a sold white oval.  I was on a delivery route in Pflugerville, Texas.  It was 11:15 in the morning, 60 degrees with a beautiful blue sky.   I pulled into an apartment complex off of the 35 freeway and saw something white floating/hovering in the sky to the north.   I stopped in the driveway of the complex to focus on the object.   It looked like a white plastic bag tossing in the wind, morphing in shape the way a bag would morph in the wind, but it was staying in the same spot, at about a 45 degree angle up and what looked like maybe one or two miles away.   Unable to figure out what it was, I pulled the rest of the way into the parking lot and got out, hoping it wouldn’t disappear in the 30 seconds it took to do that.   It was still there, still in the same spot, still morphing or flopping about.   I thought, ‘that can’t be a plastic bag, as it’s too far away for it to be as big as i see it’ (a little smaller than a dime held at arms length) - it would have to be an enormous plastic bag if that were the case.   So i thought, ‘okay, is it a paraglider twisting and turning?’  but it never showed itself to be that.  I can usually get that figured out pretty quickly as they move about.  So no, it wasn’t that.   After a couple of minutes of watching it and wondering what it was, it stopped morphing and became a stable, hovering, oval-shaped white object.  I couldn’t tell if it was a light, or if it was just a bright white object reflecting off the sun against the blue sky.   I got my phone to try to take a video, but after a few seconds I knew I wasn't going to get it (plus I don’t know how to work the zoom on my phone, if there is one), so i gave that up and just observed it.   A couple of apartment complex workers came up to see what i was looking at.  I point it out to them and one of them said, ""It’s a plane.""  I responded, ""No, that’s not a plane"", and they leave.   At this point I noticed that it seemed to be getting further away, like it was receding away from me - it wasn’t moving left or right, and it stayed at the same 45 degree angle up in the sky, but it was getting smaller, like it was moving directly away from me, all the while still a solid white oval.   I thought it must be 10 or so miles away now, so I called my brother in Round Rock, Texas, ten miles north of where I was at, and told him what I was seeing and asked him to go out to see if he also could see it.  He went out but couldn't find it.   I continued to watch it for a few more minutes and watched as it got smaller and smaller, still apparently moving directly away from me, until it looked just like a bright star in the clear daytime sky, far enough away now that I couldn’t see the oval shape to it anymore.   I decided to make the delivery that I was scheduled to make at the apartment complex.  It took about five minutes to do so, and when I finished, I tried to locate the object again, but couldn’t find it.   There was no sound associated with the object that I could hear.  The length of time of my observation was about 7 minutes.  In that amount of time, I think I should have been able to identify what I was looking at, eventually seeing wings, or movement, or a change in course that would have allowed me to see it from a different perspective and know what it was.  That never happened.",
Seen light outside southwest. It started moving torward  the north after a short time.  The subject was southwest of my home. I was sitting on couch looked over torward the window. And seen this light look sort of like a rectangle with some jagged edges on top.it was there it seemed for awhile then started moving slowly torward the north.,
"please see above sorry  I would guess at 5,000 feet Going very fast.  300+ mph Absolutly no sound Shaped like a boomerang,  pretty large.  100-150 feet wide.  50 feet diameter in the middle.  not sure how thick it was first one was moving due South then turned and went off to the South East.  Then about a minute later a second one came straight overhead and traveling from the North due South without any change.  It was very calm not even a breeze, not a cloud in the sky.  The objects had the appearance of transparancy like a cloud, white in color.",

"Observed an unknown object flying over a cloud that resembled a helicopter with no rotors.  On June 23rd, 2021 at approximately 3:15pm, in Solon, Ohio, I had an unusual and unexplained sighting directly overhead. It was a very clear and sunny afternoon with a lot of smaller low altitude clouds like stratus or cumulus(looked like cotton balls).  I was five to ten miles from the nearest airport, and there were small private planes in the area at the time of the sighting. I was standing in a parking lot when I heard what sounded like a low flying plane that was revving up. It sounded bigger than a Cessna 150 due to the high volume level, but I couldn't see it, probably because of the large building I was next to. That got me to looking around to see if I could spot it. I looked all around, then straight up.  Directly above me was one of those smaller clouds I mentioned. I'm estimating it's altitude at between 6 and 10 thousand feet. Approaching the cloud, not moving very fast, was an object that at first glance I thought was a helicopter. I say that because I could see no wings and it had the general shape of a copter, but more rectangular with kind of a military look. It also had a thinner trailing section that resembled a helicopter's boom. It moved in a straight line.  The odd thing is, I could not see any rotors. I was right under it and should have been able to see the main rotor spinning. At about the same time, the loud propeller sound I had been hearing started to fade, and I was listening for the signature whooping sound that helicopters make. I never heard  that sound. I continued to watch as the object actually flew over the small cloud and I continued to watch because I wanted to see it after it passed over the cloud. I must mention here that it was fairly calm and the clouds were moving slowly.  I continued to watch as I anticipated the object coming into view again. It was taking so long that I wondered if it was a helicopter that was hovering above the cloud. It shouldn't have taken more than about 15 seconds or so for the object to pass the cloud, given the observed speed of it going over.  I never saw it again, and I don't think I ever heard it. As I continued to watch, the cloud began breaking up and dissipating rapidly. From my perspective, it was as if the object just disappeared .  I have a lifelong interest in ufology, and was long ago convinced that they represent a real nuts and bolts phenomenon. However, I'm not convinced of their origin one way or another. I'm skeptical of a lot of stories I've heard and seen and I try to remain objective. I also have a lifelong interest in anything that flies, especially jets and rockets. I consider myself to be a decent observer when it comes to identifying aircraft, at least in general terms. I would like to know if anyone else has seen an object of the same description.",
We were traveling in Newton Township alongside the Hiawatha National Forest to Munising.  I saw a bright flash of light to my left.  I kept watching the sky.  My wife and I saw a disk shaped object with lights that would dim then get really bright.  It was hovering for a moment over the forest before floating on.  I picked up my phone and captured a video.  Not the best quality.  But you can definitely see it.,
"When I was sitting outside I've seened 6 glowing orange lights coming from JFK airport in the sky,not making any sounds all six of them,glowing orange,there was a helicopter in the sky not next to theses things at all,they were moving fast,when they reach my house towards the back of the house tree lethes they all disappeared just like that,wow,then 26 minutes later a plane was sent to investigate the area,don't know what agency?",
"Unknown bright object disappears in a cloudless sky  I was prepping my telescope to look at Venus and Mars.  As I was pulling the legs into place I looked up to make sure I was pointing in a good angle.  I glanced up higher because another bright object caught my eye.  It seemed to almost be hovering with no actual movement but I could be wrong on that, it could have been proceeding extremely slow toward the west.  It kinda had a glow to it like the sun was reflecting off of it.  I was waiting for the glare to stop so I could make out what it was, when it just disappeared, literally vanished. I hadn’t blinked and it was gone; it was just there and then it wasn’t.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I was in our atmosphere for sure, I am no good with distances so I could not give you a distance worth noting.  After standing in disbelief and confusion I noted a plane crossing much higher up to the right of the  object but it was leaving a contrail it was a passenger plane for sure.  Whatever I saw left zero contrail.  This happened against a stunningly clear cloudless sky. Still daylight but a setting sun.  I am an Evidence Technician for a local Police Station.",
"various pictures taken with stealth cam showing one object breaking into two objects sending light beams to the ground then going back  July 11, 2021 We have trail cams in the windows of our cabin to observe if there are any intruders lurking around when we are not there. We do not go to the cabin or check the cameras often but when checked seen pictures from July 11, 2021 that were unlike anything that we have seen. 7:15 PM – Land, water and clouds 7:26 PM - In the sky an Oval object with red trailing from the bottom 7:27 PM - Object changing shape from oval to a bigger round with smaller round to the side and the red trailing now to the left side 7:34 PM - Object now closer to the ground, larger round on top with smaller round attached to the bottom and emitting lightbeams to the water in the small cove 7:39 PM - Large round on top with smaller round separated emitting lightbeams to water in the cove a little further out 7:39 PM - 8:14 PM No pictures between that timeframe 8:14 PM – Sky very bright around the two objects that are still emitting lightbeams to the water in the cove a little further out 8:15 PM – Sky is still very bright with large round object and smaller round object getting closer together and are still emitting lightbeams to the water. To the left of the objects by the cloud looks a saucerlike object with 3 lights 8:24 PM – Objects are now one object and higher in the sky but still emitting some lightbeams to the water. Bottom left, above the treeline following behind looks like the three lights that were in the saucerlike object. Water now has a bright lights at the beginning of the cove where the beams were emitting. Around the nose of the cove is now a red light on the water. 8:35 PM – Objects are nowhere in sight July 11, 2021 the camera took 35 pictures between 5:48 PM and 9:10 PM which is an unusual amount as it takes only a picture occasionally.  I am limited to attach 5 pictures cannot attach all 8. The first 2 I have attached looks as if they are cropped when attaching and not showing object but should be visible if you are receiving the full picture.",
My friend and I arrived at Clearwater Lake for a fishing trip. I noticed a capsule shaped silver colored object across the lake in the western sky approximately 500 yards away. It was stationary for a few minutes while we unloaded the boat. As we began our take off it began to move toward the north. As we headed up the lake it continued that direction until it was out of sight. Never heard a sound as from any engine nor did I observe any way for the craft to move.,
"Bright light about 30 degree off the southern horizon that appeared to shoot up almost instantly.  At approx 12:05 pm on 11/30/21 as I was driving south on a road I drive everyday I saw a bright object about 30 degrees off the horizon. It looked almost like a streak coming off of it as though it was traveling west to east but as I saw it it wasn't moving. As I reached to try to grab my phone to take picture since I thought it was interesting enough to show the wife I saw out of the corner of my eye instantly shoot up and there was nothing left. At first I thought it might be a comet but since it appeared to go up I knew that couldn't be it and as I saw it there didn't appear to be any movement. Also there is a small to midsized airport about half a mile west from where I was, but the object wasn't near there and there is no small plane, or large for that matter, that could be gone in an instant like this appeared to. Also I know it wasn't Venus since I see that when I drive home from work everyday this time of year at about the same height off the horizon, but Venus is about 15 degrees to the west from where this was. Plus I've never seen it at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. To say this is a UFO only in the literal sense that it was unidentified to me, but it seemed odd enough to find a reporting sight.",
"The past 3 nights my husband and I have seen between an orange to a red glow light that appears moving erratically then disappears and reappears again this has all been at the same time at night 9:42pm mountain standard time. It moves fast stops then Slowly moves only to start blinking as it descents down and disappears then reappears in erratic movements almost as if it had landed and took off. Tonight May 2nd was a different story we saw the red lights again at 9:42pm due the routine. At 11:15pm mst we noticed a very bright white light off into the distance moving erratically the weird thing was there were vehicle light off to the distance from where these lights where. The strange thing about this the two vehicle lights turned into what appeared to be 4 vehicles that disappeared. There aren't any thing that would mask the ""vehicle lights"" they were lined up in a straight row almost as if the tail lights were pointed in our direction in which cas! e would be impossible for it was on a road not a parking lot. I believe this was an aircraft. This was not caught on tape as it wasn't picked up by cell phone video camera. My husband did say that for a brief time his video did see facial recognition.",
Stepped outside around 11:30 pm was looking south east and saw a faded triangle shape light fly from west to east at a very high speed no blinking light like I see on A plane  also that it flew in a path that jetliners do not fly,
Bright white beam shot towards me while floating white lit craft hovers 2 and a half feet above back yard.  It was around 1:00 in the morning.I woke up thirsty for a drink so I went into the kitchen to get some water when I noticed a strange white light through the blinds of my window facing the backyard. I set my drink down on the table while I opened the back door leading to the backyard. While I was walking down the concrete path that lead to the end of my back yard to take a closer look at what was going on I heard a foot step in the immediate vicinity. Obviously shooken up I made a b line towards the door which I exited only to be hit by this paralyzing beam of white light. Next thing I know I'm back in my kitchen sitting upright in my chair. All seemed normal until I looked at the clock on the kitchen stove and saw the time was 5:00 am. Not wanting to bring any unwanted attention to myself I decided to keep it quite for the rest of the school day until what happend next. Being a accomplished track runner for my high school I normally find it easy to not get ! fatigued or have anything unusual happen after I'm exhausted Today was unique in that after I felt absolutely sick to my stomich.I told my coach I wasn't feeling well and he let me go use the bathroom.As soon as I made it I threw up in the toilet but this was no normal looking vomit. It had a solid blue like texture and before I knew it this unusual bug like thing was sitting right there on the bottom of the toilet bowl before crawling down the pipe. I believe there was some type of experiment used on me maybe even containing the creature also known formally as the face hugger. Being the dumb guy I am i still considered to keep this to myself since anybody else would not belief me and think I'm crazy.I tried to get photographic evidence but the creature that came out of my mouth moved to fast. As of typing this I have never experienced such a crazy event in my life and still have trouble believing what happend to me. I can't explain why but I did not feel any fatigue at all! while running and was questioned by everyone why I didn't see! m exuast ed like the rest of the group. Whatever that was that came out of me must have left some type of effect that delays the exhaustion period after physical excersion.It is not my intent to spread false information and would never try to trick the person reading this into something thats simply not true. I just want to encourage anybody else that has experienced the same type of events that happend to me to not be afraid to pubically admit it before it is to late. The only power these creatures have over us is the ability to make us doubt our own memory. I hope everyone who is reading this does not have to go through the same events as I did and never have to come in contact with these horryfying beings.,
"Black Triangle UFO with Seven Dims Yellow Lights  Me and my parents traveled to SANYA,HAINAN ISLAND, South China Sea for a month-long vacation from April to May in 2021, the night we saw this object is at 7pm. (4.29), it was a quiet evening, only the faint calls of tropical insects, me and my parents were taking a walk at the street we lived in, my mom was walking in front of us, my dad was walking backwards, I was heading ahead, me and my dad were in a face-to-face position, chatting a little. After took a peaceful walk for a while, suddenly he said ""Why are these stars arranged so neatly?"" I look up right away, As if it found out that it’s been discovered, it’s moved towards us, i saw this black triangle object moved from 1km to 100m in 4 seconds to right above my head then moved away in 10 seconds over the tree top. The lights appears to Disguised as stars at the beginning, then when it came close i found it's changed it’s light mode into very dim lights in a few seconds. It’s not like any of the earth-made lights being: No light rhyme, extremely even and consistent light, no flash, very stable.regular circles, not an astigmatism-like luminous object on earth. The object cause No sound or air disturbance or any of that,the Movement of that object is smooth and easy, not like any of the terrestrial craft that will cause interference or disturbance of the air. It's even more darker than the sky, Its material composition is not reflective like earth-made metals. for my recall it’s about About 50 metres long or even bigger.Its existence seemed deeper than the background sky, Its edges are so sharp, then I realised its weight and texture at that time, sort of mixed texture, very heavy.. i still recall the lights that appears has embedded on it, the surface of its triangular row is not a coating or something, but a non-reflective metal material. This makes it more incredible to move quickly and smoothly without resistance. On the rest of the journey after its appearance, I thought day and night that now I can still go back to the scene at that time, and all the details are so clearly visible. The most incredible detail I can recall now is that the light has no radiance, just like the light solidifies in it.  This Object Moved From South To North. From the Ocean side To the Mountain side.  Here is the Longitude and latitude on Google Earth of the Place I witnessed this object : Google Earth Link https://earth.app.goo.gl/?apn=com.google.earth&isi=293622097&ius=googleearth&link=httpsearth.google.comweb18.23773602,109.63833375,11.80795215a,121.79790221d,35y,5.06542051h,22.68833021t,0r #googleearth complete post on reddit : https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/t5vyn9/improved_version_drawing_of_the_triangle_ufo_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",
"Fast moving light seen in early morning sky of Fort myers, Florida.  Morning of April 26, 2021, ~06:21-06:23  We were watching the setting moon of fantastic colour, reported to be the first super moon of the year. From this westernly direction we had been looking in, a fast moving light appeared.   We don't know the elevation or exact speed. It resembled closely what a satellite might look like if it was more relatively fixed in position.   It moved in an easternly direction, towards the the sun that had yet to rise.   At fist we thought it a plane, but it could not be any commercial or recreational aircraft judging by how fast it appeared to move. We did not hear or feel the sound barrier breaking. We considered the object possibly to be of military or Space X origin, but we, cannot say for certain.   The object soon disappeared within a minute or two. We were unprepared to do calculations of any sort.",
Small silver/white disk shaped object traveling in excess of 2-300 mph south of Kingman AZ  Small silver/white disk shaped object size of a normal car flying at excessive speed well over 2-300 mph with no sound heading north. Flying at low altitude approximately 1/2 mile.  I was recording a large approaching storm while driving southbound on I -93 near Mcgarrys wash. Only upon review of the video did I capture a 7 second clip of the ufo darting north.,
It was night and me and my aunt were looking at the stars and we saw these orange flares that were hovering off.  It was night and it was like 2021 I think and I was in my back yard.,
Very bright and pill shaped/horizontal flat  The object first went across with no jet streams behind it. Five minutes later it appeared going in the same circular routine. It appeared 5 separate times and would hide back and forth behind the clouds. Some of the appearances had the streams behind it like a jet. It was so bright like as if it was iridescent. It had no sound. Last time it came by it had a set of wings on each side .,
"We saw a light hovering that appeared to have another smaller orbiting sphere, it appeared out of nowhere and disappeared as suddenly  My wife and I were enjoying the sunset around 5:35pm on January, 31 2022 when we noticed a bright white dot in the sky. We were looking eastward toward a peak called Lone Peak in the Wasatch Mountain range. The only land behind our home is BLM land with no buildings or lights just mountain terrain and high desert vegetation so we had a clear unobstructed view of this. We thought it was a star at first but the time of day seemed too early for a star to be so visible and bright. We watched it for several minutes and observed that there appeared to be two dots with one stationary and the other appearing to orbit the other or move side to side either in front or behind. As the sunset progressed the colors changed on the peaks but the object just stayed in the same place so we had a pretty good idea that this object was stationary and not moving with the orbit or movement of the sky. We watched this for about 20-25 minutes then the lights got dimmer and two smaller lights appeared below the center object so now there were 3 separate lights lined up vertically and they all got dimmer and dimmer then disappeared. That’s all we saw and for the next 45 minutes we continued to look in the same direction hoping to see something else but only to see Orion appear in the night sky. It was great!",
"12 red lights in the sky low to the horizon in Paulding County, GA.  Riding in a car home from North Paulding High School I saw approximatley 12 red lights in the sky low to the horizon looking like they were at various heights in the sky. Some moved up, some down, and they all seemed to be moving in the same direction.",
A strange star that Vanished  we were outside letting the dogs do their business and saw a slow moving star like bright orb with one light moving slowly east through the sky toward mountain and not blinking. It continues slow and smooth. Watched for about ten seconds and the orb fizzled and changed to a reddish color and disappeared. No cloud clear night,
"Bright sphere at an angle of 100 degrees in the sky and followed the curve of the earth downward very rapidly - large and bright  From the back of the field where i was standing with my dog observing the constellations orion, aries and taurus (we remained facing this direction) farther to my right and at estimated 100 degree angle from me (not directly above my head) a large white sphere moved rapidly downward falling the curve of the earth, it moved in one continous path without jerking or veering. It had no sound or tail/trail of light. It was significantly larger than any comet, satellite or shooting star I had ever observed and significantly brighter. It reached a point behind the nearby trees and I could no longer see it. When it was visible its light was similar in size and brightness of a streetlamp except it was perfectly round and a white light with a very subtle halo of light around it. In the sky were 4 planes, several planets and many visible stars, all incredibly small in comparison to the U.F.O and in comparison from their distance to me. No other witnesses were with me but I could hear local children out and normal small town commotion with no noticeably strange sounds. Finally I will say that its movement through the sky was strange it moved very rapidly and smoothly with no resistance - in comparison to the planes in the sky it wad incredibly fast.",
The sky was clear with no clouds. The object appeared to be smaller than a vehicle. It was hovering (not flying or floating) and it appeared to tilt from one side to its opposite side (left to right). It appeared to be be metalic as it tilted from side to side the sun reflected off of one of its sides. It was clearly not a normal flying object. It literally just disappeared. My daughter and I pulled over in our vehicle to get a better look. It was impossible to compare it to anything as I have never seen anything like it before.,

This is second sighting. This one was closer it appeared on the horizon of the ocean but high up in the air than the previous sighting  Saw a UFO sighting this time it was closer and higher up in the air. around 5am I abruptly woke up which I normally do not and went to the balcony (beachfront) and saw UFO with lights flashing and hovering in the same spot. after 30-40 minutes it started to disappear very quickly further out into the ocean. This was the second sighting the first one which was a few days prior had flashing lights white and a one red light and it appeared to be hovering over the ocean (NOT A SHIP) this was a night also.,

"neighbor ((Name deleted)) came to get my sister, me amd maid to see ufo overhead is street no higher than a telephone pole. Made humming noise. Can only remember the underbelly appearing to have a constant flow of electricity/fire shooting front to back or visa versa. Watched it from treehouse go over to the jr highschool and move in an orbital motion until I got bored and went inside. I was 12 or 13 at the time. My sister doesnt remember really.She was 8.    The maid remembers it as a KFC advertisement on a helicopter or some such. Where is Billy ((deleted)) and his sister who came and got us in the first place ? I bet he could corraborate my story 30+ years later. my sister myself and the neighbors watched a ufo at close range for a prolonged amount of time =  neighbor amd his sister came to get me my sister and maid to see the ufo in the street no higher up than a telephone pole. It made only a humming noise and was competely motionless. I vaguely remember it being round or eliptical. The only other strong impression I have is of the electrical/ fire energy shooting constantly from front to back or visa versa.We watched it move away and could see it from the treehouse in the general area of the jr highschool moving in an orbital pattern round and round. Finally  my sister and I got bored and went back inside. I was 12 or 13 at the time which would make my sister 8 or 9. She doesnt really remember and the maid now says she knows it was one of those helicopters selling KFC. I would like to find the neighbor kids..... I bet they remember!

"Stepped out in the backyard and was enjoying the evening noticed lower than the clouds normally are, 5-7 slightly off white (not glaring) lights flying in a not quite striaght line, but more like an angle. Sort of like the left arm of a ""V"" formation. i looked to see if was a dark shadow of a plane wing or something, but no shape.There was no noise associated with them. They moved rather slowly, then suddenly disappeared.  I tried to get the kids to come out to witness the lights move slowly ove the back yard, but couldn't get them outside in time. I tried to get a date and time from the Lake County Sherriff records department, because I reported the above, but they said they hadn't gotten computers in yet and many times didn't keep the hand written reports made. That night when the deputy came I asked if anybody else had made a simular report? He said he wasn't aware of any. This has bothered me for years. Several years ago in Idaho my husband, two older children and I had seen very bright, small star like things (two of them) that seemed to be out of this atmosphere darting to and fro, one minute in one spot then all of a sudden in an other spot so fast your human eye lost track of them for a moment. We saw another just like the two only it was only one in California.  I don't remember dates or time of year on either The Idaho event or California event.",
U.F.Os spotted hovering above Normandie Avenue Elementary school between 1972-1974  Normandie Avenue Elementary school between 1972-1974(?)in Los Angeles we were at recess when i noticed all the kids looking up at the sky! I looked up and saw three space crafts hovering in mid air they were  grayish silver kind of color and round like saucer shape but more detail..there was no sound and they seemed to be in triangle formation...all of a suuden L.A police helopcopter came from my right side and was approaching the crafts i looked at the chopper then looked back were the crafts were and they were gone just like that no sound no trails just gone.

"I was driving when i saw blue lights that looked like an airplane landing. As i got closer i could see how close to the ground they were, just above the tree line.one pair of lights did a complete u-turn, and started to ascend and thats when i noticed a second smaller pair of lights follow on the same exact path. ,At this point, Ii had no idea what i was looking at and as i realized this is nothing ive seen, they were about 2 miles away, went over a further away higher elevation tree line and back down and completely out of sight",
"Watched a bright blue ball, in the evening, for about three blocks in a residential area in Northeast Portland.  It was about 50 feet overhead.  Went for an evening walk in a residential neighborhood in NE Portland.  While walking I noticed a blue cast on a lawn.  I looked over at the house thinking that it must be Christmas lights not yet taken down, but there were none.  Thought nothing more about it.  About five minutes later I again noticed the blue cast on a lawn.  This time I looked up.  Directly overhead was a bright blue ball.  Apparently it had been following me.  I stopped and the ball contined moving.  I estimated it at about 100 foot above the ground, and about 2-3 feet in diameter.  I based this estimate on a tree that it passed over.  It moved very slowly for about a block, then banked left but continued moving.  When it banked left a bright orange light came on in the center of the ball.  I watched it move for about 2 more blocks, then it simply disappeared.  I looked for searchlights or any lights in the sky but there were none.  I then became quite frightened and returned home. I retraced my steps the next day.  No Christmas tree lights.  I revised my estimate of height to about 50 feet above the ground because the tree that I used for estimating was much shorter than it appeared in the dark.  I mentioned the blue ball to my brother who suggested that it might be ball lightning.  I checked the weather and there was some lightning in the Portland area that evening.  Have never seen anything like it before or since.  The blue ball was simply beautiful Background.  I'm ((age deleted)) and recently retired but at the time was working as a manager for the State ((deleted)) agency.",
"I was a young boy, perhaps twelve or so. My friends and I were playing in the steet, a game that we called frisbee football. Anyway, I was in their endzone and threw a pass all the way down the street, and all the kids took off running, save me, because something caught my attention. I looked over my right shoulder and saw a bright green sphere hovering about  I was a child brought up in a mid-level family living in the suburbs of Chicago Ill. Again all I can say about the description is that it was a big glowing ball of green light, which illuminated the surrounding area.",

"I saw an orange ball of light in cornfield raise straight up and at low altitute fly directly toward my home and over my house.  It appearred as an orange ball until it was over a nearby tree.  I could then see the bottom of craft which was made up of copper looking squares and rectngles which were riveted, with two cylinders  which were emitting sparks. There was no sound.  Object was a perfect triangle, appeared very clean and shiny, but not usual silvery color.  Definitely copper colored.

"Aircraft entered the area from the south following weed road, north, just below the tree tops and at a speed of about 15 miles per hour.  There was no audible engine noise, however, there was what appeared to be thrashing noises in the air that could be just heard through closed doors.  I would not have noticed the aircraft except that it turned on a powerful search light which lit up the room and I was able to track its progress through the area.  It appeared to be about 8 feet thick and about 15 feet in diameter, dark colored, with no shine. It continued North on Weed road until it went out of sight.  My first thought was it's a new secret military scout aircraft and this would be a great place for cold weather testing. But, who knows?  With the search light off it would be almost impossible to track visually.",
"My husband woke me up to see this.  It is hard to describe because it was inside a cloud.  It had an outer ring of triangular lights that were bluish white.  They fashed one at a time around in a circle, sometimes faster sometimes slower.  It had an inner ring of lights that moved as if it were opening and closing sort of like jellyfish do when propelling themselves forward.  It did not move it just hovered there for hours, Gradually getting higher in they sky as the sun rose. I stood under it and so did my kids and neighbor.  It didn't make any sound.   It was reported in our local paper and policemen had seen it ect.  Hundreds have seen it but we do live by a Air Force Base and so most of us just figure that it is a new plane or something.  Many witnessed it moving from Ogden area to the Layton area, to my area.    I would like to know if anyone else saw this and could explain what it was.

"3 Moving Lights - NO engine Sound, erratic non-linear hovering movements in the English countryside near Television mast. Objects also had a blinking light as if signalling each other, blinked only when another crafty had blinked. Lights were very low in the sky.  The time was about 05.00 am, on my way to work I have to travel from a small village 3 miles into a nearby town. I live near our local T.V. mast and it one day became suddenly common for fighter planes to be out at around this time. Now these fighters ( Our nearest RAF base is RAF St Mawgan, not far away) had sound travelling behind them, yet were not moving fast which I thought strange ( I know little about planes, but I always assumed travelling faster than sound means high speed and lots of noise!), but I enjoyed watching them so I began to specifically try to spot them every morning to kill the boredom of the walk. On several occasions I spotted lights that would suddenly appear out of nowhere and then speed across the sky and disappear in an instant. I guessed that maybe RAF St Mawgan had sent some planes out to patrol the area as maybe they were aware of such objects on their radars. But on two occassions I spotted these lights just hovering, totally silently, not far away and low in the sky. The first incident occured on Caradon Hill by the TV mast - a light moving and hovering not far from the tip of the aerial at about 05.00. I thought it a star at first but when I realised it was to low I watched it and the light moved about! I could not stay to watch too long because i would have been late to work. The second incident was under the same circumstances - on my way to work at 05.00 - it happened at 05.30, except this time they were near the main road that leads into the town of Liskeard. There were three silent lights this time, low in the sky, hardly moving and just signalling to each other. I would have watched further but somebody pulled over to give me a ride - I did not wish to mention the matter to them - so I left it. I have never seen any craft - just lights that either move or hover a little erratically low in the sky. The sky was clear - no cloud, stars clearly visible. I no longer live out that way, but I may one day  camp out on the hill one evening just in case I get to see any more - it was quite incredible as I am unaware of any craft we have that is able to silently hover and move so erratically.",

"I FIRST OF ALL DID NOT SEE A CRAFT. BUT WHAT I DIDI SEE HAS STAYED WITH ME TO THIS DAY. I WAS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF MY FRIENDS FATHERS CAR. WE WERE ON OUR WAY FISHING WE TURNED DOWN A ROAD I'M NOT CERTAIN WHERE, I THINK IT WAS NEAR THE AIRPORT OR SOME TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION REQUIRING LARGE DUMP TRUCKS, THE LONG TYPE THAT CARRY LARGE LOADS OF GRAVEL AND DIRT. THERE WAS A MIST OR FOG NEAR THE AREA THAT THE TRUCKS WERE GOING IN AND OUT. WHAT WAS UNUSEUAL ABOUT TIHS MIST WAS THER WAS A LIGHT PROJECTING DOWN ON THE AREA, I THOUGHT IT WAS ON A LIGHT POLE. AS WE CAME TO THE END OF THE ROAD THERE WERE RESTRICTED SIGNS AND WE REALIZED IT WAS A DEAD END. AS WE TURNED A HUGH TRUCK PASSED US I LOOKED BACK BECAUSE IT SUPRISED ME THAT THIS AREA WAS SO BUSY THIS EARY IN THE MORNING. THE LIGHT AS WE TURNED DREW UPWARDS INTO THE MIST AND THERE WAS A SPARKLE LIKE THE EMBERS FROM A LOG IN A CAMPFIRE AS IT IS BEING MOVED OR TURNED. AT THIS POINT I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW AND WHAT SUPRISED ME WAS THE SPARKLE SORT OF IMPLODED INTO THE MIST RIGHT BEHIND THE LIGHT AND THE FOG OR MIST SURROUNDING IT MOVED TOWARDS THE GRAVEL PIT OR CONSTRUCTION AREA. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT I WAS OVERCOME. I SORT OF SAID A LITTLE SOMETHING TO MY FRIENDS FATHER, BUT NOT MUCH. AT THAT POINT I WAS WISHING FOR A PHONE TO CALL THE AIR FORCE AND JUST LEAVE A MESSAGE AND NOT TELL THEM WHO I WAS. I JUST COULD NOT ACCEPT THE FACT THERE WAS NO POLE FOR THIS LIGHT AND THE ONLY REASON IT DISSAPEARED SO FAST WAS IT SPOTTED US COMING AROUND THE EXITING GRAVEL DUMP TRUCK. THE FACT REMAINS SOMETHING WAS GOING ON HERE AND I'VE WONDERED IF SOME SECRET FACILITY WAS BEING BUILT HERE OR WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE REASON FOR THE OBSERVATION. I'M NOT POSITIVE OF THE DATE AND EXACT TIME BUT IT WAS JULY OR AUGUST AND IT WAS DARK JUST 30 TO 45 MIN BEFORE SUNRISE.",
"Object seen that had fast blinking white lights to solid red.   It went from a motionless hover to a fairly speedy flight.  While driving northerly, we saw fast blinking white lights omitting from something in the sky.   It was hovering still at maybe 1k ft. off of the road and 1k-2k ft high.    As we drove closer and became parallel to the object the lights turned solid red with a few slowly blinking white.    We  made a few turns to get closer then it started moving south, then north/east, then south/east (like a spanned zigzag) somewhat fast.  We drove 65mph and went maybe 2 miles chasing it in the time it went roughly 10 miles.  Not crazy fast, but pretty fast from hovering at a dead stop 1k ft. in the air.

Metal object in daylight sky very slow moving  I first saw it in the sky at about a 2 o'clock degree was silver like a star would be at night but this was daylight. It appeared to be at a high altitude a jet flew by and this object was higher. It started moving very slowly south which brought it to about 12 o'clock degree wise in the sky then to maybe 11 o'clock. This movement took maybe 15 minutes. The clouds were moving east to west. Then it turned back north and got to 2 o'clock but this time it took only about 5 minutes. Then it turned east at about the same speed as it did when heading north. I lost it in the sun after that. It was highly reflective metal because at times it would glint off the sun. It looked like it had angles more than soft curves. I took a couple pictures on my phone at 8X magnification but the image is pretty blurry,
UFO sighting from West Hollywood looking NE  Viewed from the pool deck of the Montrose West Hollywood.  Took note of a passing helicopter and saw the object in the distance at a higher altitude and further out.  Object was dull grey and oblong in shape and as it turned it reflected the sun in a glint flash. Observed object make orientation changes in perspective and conduct maneuvers not consistent with fixed wing or rotary wing aircraft. Took picture on personal iPhone.  Object ascended in altitude until obscured by cloud cover.,

Triangular object glens falls  Walking on the bike trail with my wife when she pointed out 3 triangular objects following each other in a line. They were grey in color and had 3 lights on the back and the bottom. I estimate that they were at 9 to 10 thousand feet and very very large. I'm thinking it's military but my wife insists on me making this report.,
"Large group of small circular objects  The sky was bright blue and clear. As I was preparing an outdoor fire for myself and my 2 kids, I noticed a plane flying off to my east. This is extremely common, as we live in the flight path for DCA. However, beyond the aircraft, at an extremely high altitude was several (12-20) white circular objects all moving together going from south to north just as the plane was traveling. At first, I didn’t think much of it but as I was getting the firewood ready I began to think: this is extremely odd. So, I said to my kids: look at this guys, dad has never seen anything like this. My six year old observed the objects too and we were both puzzled by the I thought maybe they could be weather balloons but I do not believe they are released in such a large number. I tried to take a picture but my iPhone would not zoom that far, these objects were hard to see with the naked eye.",

"My wife and I were sitting on the grass in the park overlooking the water of Lake Michigan at Montrose Harbor facing East. The sky was fairly clear. Some clouds in the distance. We are familiar with the area. There is considerable air traffic into O'Hare airport. We saw three spherical silver shining orbs in formation traveling West to East below the typical airplane flight path elevation. They were traveling quite faster than typical commercial aircraft. I pointed them out to my wife. She saw them as well. They disappeared into the distant cloud formation to the east. This happened approximately 6:20 p.m. on May 1, 2021. Weather was clear and sunny. Approximately 3 to 5 minutes after we observed this event, I saw another single spherical silver shining object traveling in the same direction. This object was just as fast as the others. There was no sound coming from the objects. The formation they held and speed was incredible.",

"Dancing red lights above elkhorn basin.  While camping in the elkhorn basin, my father and I saw a red light in the sky approximately 20-30 miles away from our location. We had an expansive view and could see many miles in all directions. Our sightings occurred in 3 separate events, as the light would drop below the horizon and reappear again later in a different part of the sky. The light had a gentle pulsing appearance, where the brightness would fluctuate by about +-20%.   The first sighting way at approximately 9pm. The light was moving back and forth across the sky in a zigzag pattern, while also moving up and down perfectly vertical. It would also have erratic bursts of speed where I estimate it would cover many miles in less than 1 second. The light dropped below the horizon and we went inside. The sighting lasted for approx 5-10 minutes.   About 30 minutes later we witnessed a similar light, possibly the same one, in a different part of the sky. It was behaving in the same manner as the first one we saw. This sighting lasted for approx 15 minutes.   30 minutes after the previous sighting another strange light was spotted. This time approx 90 degrees, to the west, away from the initial sighting. This light was much brighter and was white. It was behaving in the same erratic manner as the other lights before. After watching it for several minutes it headed north east and it the erratic behavior ceesed. While the bright white light was moving we also noticed a smaller, seemingly much more distant, light lower in the horizon. That light was red and behaving like the initial light, doing loops and moving in a somewhat random pattern.",

"Unusual path and abrupt changes of direction by a star-like object in the sky  On Sunday, May 2 at around 8:45 PM I was outside on the deck of my significant other's house in Westport, CT with a group of 6 people when I casually looked up to the sky at the Big Dipper.  I saw what, at first, appeared to be a star / plane-like object (yellowish-orange in color) moving fairly normally downwards in the sky near the 2nd star of the Big Dipper handle at roughly commercial airplane altitude.  But then, a few seconds later, what caught my eye was that this object performed a sudden - albeit slight - turn in direction (no more than 30 degrees).  It wasn't a gradual, arc-like turn but rather a pretty sudden turn on a point in the sky.  A couple seconds later, it repeated a similar turn on another point in the sky.  4-5 such turns were made within the span of 15-20 seconds so that after that time the object had completely changed its direction and was now heading upwards in the sky on the other side of the same star of the Dipper...and then it (g! radually) disappeared.  From a physics standpoint, it was as if something had entered the atmosphere, took this unusual path, and then exited the atmosphere.  I am 43 years old and I had never seen anything like this before.  It became obvious that it was neither a plane nor a meteor.  I thought that it could, perhaps, be some kind of satellite capable of making such sudden turns...but I later discovered that such motion was impossible for satellites as well (unless something catastrophic was happening with the satellite).  Just when I thought I'd seen a one-time unusual event...about 5 minutes later I see a similar yellowish-orange object appear just outside the the far side of the Big Dipper pan and slowly making its way under the pan and towards the handle.  This time, I quickly called attention to the object to both my girlfriend and another guest at the gathering (he was about 60 years old) and they both confirmed that the strange object was neither a plane nor a meteo! r.  The object continued on its trajectory across that part of! the sky making a gradual arc (straighter than the first) in that part of the sky until it had passed the Big Dipper handle.  It then gradually disappeared afterwards.  This object's somewhat erratic path lasted 30-45 seconds.",
"Two bright white object moving in high rate of speed and synchronized movements.  At approximately 22:50, on the evening of Sunday, the 2nd of May, 2021, I witnessed 2, small but very bright lights traveling at a very high rate of speed traveling in a westerly direction coming from over land and heading out over the Gulf of Mexico. At first I thought I was witnessing two meteors as they were traveling much faster than any aircraft or other man made object could.   I tracked them for approximately 20 seconds in a straight line. Both objects were traveling side by side, in the exact same direction and speed. At that time, both objects made four very distinct course corrections. Both objects made the same zig zag, “z”  shaped movements. First to the right, back to the left, back to the right and finally left continuing westerly in a straight line and at a burst rate of speed before disappearing.   The speed, distance apart and the movements were identical and did not very from the each other. Due to the precision, speed of the movements and rate of acceleration, I am confident these were a form of mechanical objects that were neither a man made or natural objects.",
Tall being disappeared and at night I woke from sleep in pain.  I was closing the curtains to my bedroom window and had my flashlight on so I wouldn't wake my wife. When I approached the window I noticed a *estimated 7 to 8 foot tall being. It quickly turned toward me and took two steps back. As it stepped back it seemed to disappear from a gray hue and I could only see the neighbors shed which was behind it from my perspective. I stood there with my light reflecting off the wall and illuminating my body which in hindsight was a mistake. After a few more seconds I turned off my light and watched for anything else. I didn't see anything else so I went to bed. I fell asleep and eventually awoke from pain in my head. It was a unique sensation that felt like some form of electricity through my brain. I was immobilized during the event and it caused pain in my teeth. It took I would estimate less than 1 minute but it felt much longer likely due to adrenaline. When it was done I could move again and could speak. My teeth remained odd feeling for the next day approximately. I can't be certain but I think there were long term effects on my memory and understanding/comprehension. A couple weeks later it was raining outside and the rain stopped over my house but was raining across the street. Then in about 2 seconds it was raining on my house again. I did not feel or see anything during that event.,
Drone footage of impossible fast moving object.  I did not notice the object until I reviewed the videos that I had collected on the sd card in my drone. I was flying my DJI drone over the green belt behind my house when my low battery indicator came on so I lowered the gimbal to look straight down while descending to the takeoff point. The drone was at 300 ft when it captured the fast moving object that looks like white slightly stretched ball although that could be motion blur. The object is only visible in three frames of the 30 FPS I was shooting in. The object is moving much faster then any bird or insect I have captured in hd.  I recently watched a show called contact on the discovery network witch aired a segment of a very similar incident. A drone pilot was capturing b roll when he also captures a fast moving object. He also noticed it later when reviewing the vid. I believe have the same thing stored on my laptop and sd card.,

"Bright mini sized moon appeared near dusk in the northern sky for about 5 minutes and then zoomed out of sight  Greetings, I’m an automation specialist and have been working in the field of electronic technology for over 50 years. I am 70 years old. I have seen a few odd things in the sky in my life but this was the most unusual and unexplained.   I’m reporting this recent sighting because I have seen nothing about it on any news outlet. I was so shocked by what I saw that I thought it would be global news.   This is my account of what I saw in the sky on May 3, 2021 in Brandon, Ms.  I was outside in the early evening working on a new front porch addition. I noticed that it was 7:30 pm and looked up to the sky as I was sitting down to see if I could see bats flying overhead. I had noticed bats coming out to eat insects the evening before at that same time and wanted to see if they were out again and they were. As I was looking to the north, I saw a very bright object. I thought maybe it was Venus because it was so bright and big but it was in the wrong place and this object had an odd flare coming out of one side of it almost like a comet trail but very short. It sort of looked like what you would see if you threw paint ball on a flat surface and it splattered a bit in one direction– round with a few rays and a bit smudged.   When I noticed the flare, I ran inside to get my binoculars and lost a minute or two looking. All I could fine was my oversize pair so I grab them and went back outside. The object was still there and had grown larger but the flare was gone. I tried to focus on it. My binoculars are very large and hard to handle without a mount but I was able to focus on it and I was shocked into disbelief. I had no idea what I was looking at.  It looked like miniature moon about 3 or 4 time the size of Venus as observed from earth and just as bright.  It was bright silver with shaded areas and absolutely round.   There was not another light in the sky – no stars, no planets and the sky was still filled with light from the sun as it was setting. There was a storm rolling in, a tornado watch and the sky was a bit hazy. I doubt that there were many people in my area outside looking up at the time.  I put the binoculars down and picked up my phone to bring up my astronomy app to see if I could identify what it was that I was seeing. As I was fiddling with my phone to bring up the app ( I have to take my case off because it has a magnet on it and that destroys the accuracy of the compass and it doesn’t work for positioning)  the object started dimming and shrinking in size as if it was now heading away from my perspective. When I saw it dim, I knew the app wouldn’t recognize this strange object because it was nothing normal about it.   I decided to try to get a picture of it before it was gone and I did snap a few pictures before it disappeared but the contrast between the object and the sky was low for a camera because it was still pretty much daylight. I accidentally took 2 one second videos and they came out better than the pictures. I put the phone down and watched the object as it narrowed down to a point of light and vanished. When the object was heading away it remained perfectly round as shrunk in size and brightness.   In the two short videos you can see the effect of the atmosphere as it distorts the shape of the object. I am an amateur astronomer and I am very familiar with atmospheric distortion and the distortion I see in the videos tells me the object was above our atmosphere. I wish I could have gotten some photos of it when I first saw it because it was much bigger plus it had a flare at first but I was stunned and was kind of wondering if this was doomsday.   My first thought when I saw the object in my binoculars was that something huge was about to hit earth unannounced. It looked like a rouge moon headed directly for us. When it started moving away, I felt relief as it shrunk in size. I knew that it must be traveling at an extreme speed the way it disappeared. The whole event lasted about 5 minutes. The object pretty much stayed in the same location in the sky and did not jump or dart around. I didn’t see it come into view – it was just there when I looked up and it only moved a little in position when it took off. There was no sound, no flashing light and the only colors I saw was sliver and gray.  Since it was hazy during the observation, I have to question the detail that I saw on the object. I now assume that maybe I was seeing cloud vapor super imposed on the object and that vapor gave it the darker areas in the disk I viewed that resembled the terrain of the moon.  Now my question is – Did anybody else see this object?   My guess was that it was an asteroid making a very close fly-by but the news and the astronomy groups are saying nothing about it.  It’s seems impossible that no one else noticed it. It’s a complete mystery to me.",
"Black triangle with three white lights at each corner passed overhead slowly and silently at 9 pm in a residential area near hwy 101.  I walked out onto my deck around 9 pm and sat down. I looked up and immediately saw a big black triangular shape floating above me traveling north from the south. It had three dim orb-like lights at each corner of its triangular shape. I watched as it passed overhead in complete silence and then looked in the direction it was heading, but I couldn’t see anything. There was a commercial flight in the sky at the same time that was much higher and brighter, so I could tell this was only a few hundred feet above me, nowhere near the altitude planes fly at. It was closer to a drone in its movement, but it made no sound. The object was moving north from the south, approximately over highway 101. Vandenberg Air Force Base is south of here and it could've been coming from that direction.",
"We saw a bright fireball in the sky that was very bright and moving slowly. Initially we thought it was a drone.  As it moved towards us, it slowed down a bit. There was no noise and no blinking lights. The object the moved a bit faster into the distance. At one point it stopped and made a quick change of direction  to the right in a 90 degree angle. Then it seemed to quickly move amd fades into the distance.",

The reports consist of a wide variety of sightings, from structured craft, to lights moving erratically in the sky, to frequent sightings of mysterious orange or blue “orbs”.    Conjunction of Jupiter and Venus  Reports spiked heavily in late February and the first few days of March when Jupiter and Venus appeared just 1/2 degree apart from each other in the western sky, a rare and spectacular astronomical alignment.   Many witnesses mistook this as a single craft, and reported it as such to us both over the hotline and through our website.  We have marked these reports with a note identifying them as such, but have left them in our listings to demonstrate how certain astronomical phenomenon can be easily misinterpreted.     Pilot/Military Reports  Commercial pilots and military personnel are trained to recognize and identify all kinds of aircraft, so when they report something they can’t identify we give it a great amount of weight.   Here are some of the recently received reports that fall into this category:  Date Sighting Summary 3/5/23 Four to five pulsating bright lights that would fade in and out and would move around each other. 2/19/23   Bright white light orbs with green edges, very bright and rocketing very fast towards the ground west of PTK airport 2/12/23 Aircraft over flying Northern NY reported UFO. 2/19/23 Bluish semicircle, flying fast, making absolutely no sound 2/9/23 We saw at least 10 bright starlight looking objects that flew fast and in various directions. Multiple other pilots on guard saw them 1/19/23 Transparent orb with object in it’s center sighted over the Pacific South of the Aleutian Islands. 1/22/23 Over 30 min, observed a starlike object, moving rapidly in the vertical, and horizontal, varying intensity, for 5-10 seconds each time. 1/14/23 Looking SE from Coordinate location, viewed lights moving in circles and darting from one location to another. 1/6/23 3 smaller star-like objects moving around a brighter one making rapid speed changes and directions. 1/13/23 2 lights moving rapidly back and forth 12/27/22 High altitude dogfight. 11/9/22 Sighting of one to two extremely bright maneuvering lights at extreme distance and elevation. 7/27/21 Fiery red orb seen hovering over the city.  1/2/19 High altitude light that flashed on/off over the course of ~10 seconds.  Other Notable Sightings  Below are some of what we consider to be some of the most interesting and noteworthy reports we have received since our previous posting, some of which were seen recently and some long ago:  Date Sighting Summary 2/27/23 Bright Hovering Disc.

Did anyone else see the object at high altitude hover and then accelerate to the south. At least 4-5 other airliners saw this phenomenon as evidenced by the the ATC chatter. I know a colleague in another a/c also saw the lights. ATL controllers heard the talk about the object on guard frequency.

It looked like lightning, but only in one area. Never moved! It went on for an hour 1/2 or longer. It was extremely bright!!!!! It was happening North of Lumberton on Highway 13. It was so out of the norm, that there was one car pulled over on the side of Highway 13 standing outside his car taking video or pics one. My question, Did anyone else see? And does anyone know what was happening?

Beginning with this posting, we have added a section to each report for explanations, which appear on some reports at the bottom.   Our list of explanations include Aircraft, Balloon, Bird, Blimp, Camera Anomaly, Cloud, Contrail, Drone, Fireworks, Flares, Hoax, Insect, Laser, Meteor, Planet/Star, Rocket, Satellite, Searchlight, and Starlink.   We classify each explanation as Possible, Probable or Certain.  The most common misidentifications are Starlink Satellites and Camera anomalies such as lens flares or reflections.   This doesn’t mean that reports we have not tagged with an explanation are genuine extraterrestrial craft.   In fact most sightings that are reported turn out to be of a prosaic terrestrial nature.  On the other hand, many reports are so dramatic that they defy explanation, other than that they are possible alien ships or extraterrestrials.  Here is the set of new reports that are the most impressive in this regard:      7/3/23  White strobe-like light moving at very high speed with instant acceleration and deceleration, with instant 90 degree turns.    7/3/23  Starlike UFO drops a mysterious teardrop object before vanishing into thin air.    7/2/23  A short creature with big black shiny eyes ran from my shed back behind my car and then green lights flashed and it was gone.    7/1/23  Pulled alongside my boat.

Peter Davenport, Director of NUFORC, will be out of town for the next several days to attend the 23 rd  annual UFO Festival in McMinnville, Oregon, which has been sponsored by the Portland-based hotel and restaurant chain, McMenamins, Inc., since the first festival was held in May 2000.  The Festivals are friendly gatherings, and all of the speakers are experienced UFO investigators, who know well their respective subjects in the field of ufology.  For details about the festival, please see here:   https://ufofest.com/events/  We would be most grateful if people who believe they may have witnessed a UFO to refrain from calling the telephone Hotline during the next week, and instead submit a detailed description of the sighting event, using our Online Report Form.  Peter will monitor the Hotline during his absence from NUFORC headquarters, but his ability to return all but the most important calls may be limited for the next 5-7 days.  Thank you for our consideration!  Also, we are delighted to be able to share with visitors to our website the following article, written by Mr. Mitch Randall, (M.S., physics; M.S., E.E), et al:  SkyWatch: A Passive Multistatic Radar Network for the Measurement of Object Position and Velocity (worldscientific.com)  In brief, the author describes a prototype system he has built that allows the detection, and tracking, of a typical UFO out to a distance of approximately 150 kilometers (90 miles) and to an altitude of approximately 80 kilometers (49 miles).  If the described detection system functions as designed, it will be a “game changer” in the field of ufology!    Mitch will be making 2 presentations on his work at the  Contact in the Desert  conference in Indian Wells June 2-4.   Christian Stepien, NUFORC’s CTO will also be in attendance at the event.

Between 2006 and 2019 the data shows a typical binominal distro. I.e. the prob of making a report is about constant for each day between when it was seen and when the report was eventually turned in. After 2019 for some reason there seems to be signs if (unexpected!) INCREASING stigma and people becoming increasingly less likely to report anything. I’m a great one to complain. Living north of one of AUS 2 biggest airports I almost see daily lights in the sky if not small planes chasing lights in the sky (not sats). I have decided not to make any reports because there just would be too many of them and it would screw up anyone’s database. :} 							 						 					 				 				 			 				 				 					 						 							 Tom  							 																 June 12, 2023 															 Reply 																												 						 						 						 													 							 I tried looking up any old reports and did not see any.  I assume we cannot report UAP from the 60s?  I’d like to make a report from 1968, my family was stationed at Fort Knox. Our house was off base though.  I couldn’t find any report on this incident but the next day it was all over the radio and TV and 100s if not 1000s of people saw the craft it was huge.  I’m trying to make a detailed report or find others who witnessed this also.

The best way to look for any corroborating sightings would be to scroll through the report listing for Kentucky to find reports of sighting in that state from 1968.  There are 7 of them currently in our database.

Estudiando kábbalah leí información muy sugerente sobre el asunto de la merkavá, o carro divino de fuego, la cual vendría a ser como una especie de tromba giratoria de alta energía a la que llegan a vibrar seres muy avanzados espiritualmente. El caso más paradigmático sería el de Jesús. Antes, Elías o el carro de Ezequiel. La cuestión es que el misticismo judío se ocupa de esto -aunque veladamente- y refieren que el aspecto de estos seres vibrando a gran velocidad es precisamente  el de un disco de materia aparentemente sutil o plasmática, brillante, sin contornos definidos pero muy brillantes y en forma de disco o esfera. Quisiera saber especialmente si ninguna autoridad del judaísmo autorizada les ha hablado de este tema. Saludos desde Argentina  Translation: Good evening, I have been interested in the UFO topic for 50 years. While studying Kabbalah, I read some very suggestive information about the subject of the merkavah, or divine chariot of fire, which would be something like a high-energy, rotating vortex that highly spiritually advanced beings are said to reach. The most paradigmatic case would be that of Jesus, and earlier, Elijah or the chariot of Ezekiel. The thing is that Jewish mysticism deals with this – although veiled – and they refer to the appearance of these beings vibrating at high speed as exactly that of a disc of apparently subtle or plasmatic material, bright, with undefined contours but very bright and in the form of a disc or sphere. I would especially like to know if any authoritative figure in Judaism has spoken about this topic. Greetings from Argentina. 							 						 					 				 				 			 				 				 					 						 							 Jennifer  							 																 July 9, 2023 															 Reply 																												 						 						 						 													 							 I would like to add an update to my post that is listed at 4/29/23 in PRESCOTT VALLEY, AZ.   I have 100% debunked the lights as being flaring Starlink satellites. They are not UFOs. They are satellites flaring in a specific area of the sky at the same time each night for a couple of hours until the rotation of the Earth takes me out of the viewing window because the sunlight is no longer hitting the satellites in the area where I can see them. I first noticed them in the spring and it is now summer and I am still seeing them every night but the viewing area has shifted higher in the sky and the satellites are dimmer and harder to see. I expect next spring I will be able to see them brightly again. I always see them in the north between the Big Dipper and Cassiopeia constellations.  This video explains it better than I can:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8BCl2yVU0  From what I have read the satellites that I am seeing from my backyard in central AZ are over northern Canada, 2000 miles away. Amazing.  Also, I submitted several videos of the flaring satellites with my report but they were not posted. What happened to them? 							 						 					 				 				 			 				 				 					 						 							 Christian Stepien   							 																 July 9, 2023 															 Reply 																												 						 						 						 													 							 Thanks for the clarification on your report.  We receive lots of reports of misidentified Starlink satellites, and are beginning to mark them in the database and on the postings themselves.  I myself have seen them and they are quite a sight when they go over.  Regarding the videos, we receive hundreds of them, and are working on a way to post them all.  Stay tuned, as this should be available soon.

Now, almost 20 years later, Mitch Randall, working with the  Galileo Project  at Harvard, has built a working prototype and proven the concept.    The next step is to secure funding to produce a commercially available unit that anyone can buy and install.   When at least 3 of these systems are deployed in any given area, what Mitch calls Objects Outside the Paradigm of Science (or OOPS), can be detected.   These are craft that can make instantaneous non-inertial right angle turns at high velocities, something which many UFO’s have been observed to do (some cases of which have been confirmed on standard radar).   No human made object is capable of maneuvering like this.  If a network of passive radar receivers could be widely deployed, the smoking gun for proving non-human built craft exist could finally be in the hands of the general public.

It’s progressive thinking like this that will solve the UFO/UAP phenomenon, and lift the subject from mere speculation and/or entertainment where it’s been stuck for decades.    As I alluded to in a previous post, and being a student of history, the US government actually took the phenomenon seriously back in the ’70s, developing a prototype for synthetic aperture radar and then flight testing it aboard a squadron of 707s.   Depending on the altitude of the aircraft, the three dimensional imaging system had a range up to three thousand miles… seriously. Similar technology today, like the Cobra Dane facility on Shemya Island, allows the Air Force to monitor developments taking place deep within Russia.   As to the findings developed by this unnamed squadron that once crisscrossed the skies above the country, decades ago, in search of genuine unidentified flying objects… perhaps it’s all just part of history, like the fuel pumps once used on Apollo, now having to be invented  again by Boeing for the Artemis booster.   Nevertheless, job well done, Peter Davenport.

Peter has been seeking collaboration on passive radar for decades, but that cooperation has always been shut down. With all these recent high profile sightings and information being leaked out of the government, it feels like something monumental is about to come out. It seems that the multiple generation disclosure process is about to come to a head. Traditional religious faith is dying- the church has succumbed to the world. I’d assume this is a necessary step before the ET presence is officially acknowledged.   We are living in interesting times. I hope Peter is well, I miss hearing his voice on the radio. Be skeptical of government pronouncements- they will use UFO/ET disclosure for their own purposes, surely at the expense of individual freedom. 							 						 					 				 				 			 				 				 					 						 							 collins  							 																 June 24, 2023 															 Reply 																												 						 						 						 													 							 Would that be ET or AI? I share similar feelings about this moment in time, but also feel tempered by the onslaught of sophisticated drone technology and social media manipulation, the likes of which have already resulted in impressive hoaxes. I mean, I grew up with sightings made by the likes of Lonnie Zamora, who, as a New Mexico police officer, in April 1964, made what has to be one of the quintessential reports of a Close Encounter of the Third Kind; and having met the man, I remain convinced that he truly witnessed something not of this earth. On the other hand, I also enjoyed the camaraderie of George Adamski, along with Orthon and the space brothers from Venus. Adamski did for the ’50s what Whitley Strieber did for the ’80s, and revived the alien contact experience. Every alien described today comes from Strieber and the dreams that he reported that were so vivid, according to him, they may have been real. This kind of history had a time and a place in the culture, it only seemed appropriate for a generation brought up on Buck Rogers and Malt-O-Meal. But today, I recently petted a robot dog that can fire a sniper’s rifle mounted on its back and hit a target over a mile away. And then there’s the one about the robot who, in the middle of an interview, started talking about world domination, and about how it wanted to conquer the earth. So yeah, there is this anticipation… but the truth is still out there.

I live near Melbourne.au airport and we see lots of lights in the sky at night. 1/2 of them coming from the E. IYKWIM. After a few days of tinkering it managed to pick up aircraft coming over the property during the day. At dusk a couple times it managed to differentiate pairs of targets — visually one a light aircraft and the other a LIT that seemed to be of great interest to said aircraft. The AUS govt put out a story some months back it was “photographing Chinese satellites”. But the s/w I tinkered up seemed to find said satellites sometimes were at an alt of only 2000-4000m and could be chased by a fixed wing aircraft. So the good news is — some unknowns seem to reflect ~3m radio waves so the idea could be a go. Multiple receivers on one of those fancy mesh networks would probably be a bit more reliable than my setup of 2 old TV ant, 2 old FM radios off-tuned, and their audios fed into the stereo jack of my desktop comp.

This website seems to attract intelligent and level-headed folks. The forum would compliment passive radar.

Our standard procedure is to review and post these reports in batches, however we felt the following incident was significant enough to release ASAP.  On June 3, four witnesses observed what was described as an aerial “dogfight” between 2 jets and a UAP over a Meijer’s grocery store in Bad Axe Michigan.  Here is the report:  Quiet afternoon no signs of planes it’s, 10 am, in the parking lot of the storage unit across from Miejers. Myself, my wife and 2 Co workers were helping move my camper! Suddenly ear shattering afterburner on 2 what I think were F-16 or F-22 were flying together whilst dogfighting something I couldn’t see at first. They would circle fast as they could looking intently for something. Circling the sun around about 2 or 3 times and suddenly there was this white/metallic disc hard to see because it was shining with the sun, it seemed to hide in the sun from the fighters, whom obviously couldn’t see it. The UAP was extremely fast it was capable of overtaking and outmaneuvering the fighter jets with extreme ease. It would overtake a jet, stop suddenly and seemed to turn toward the incoming jet like spin in there direction without moving. The jet would shoot out anti missile flares like it was under direct attack. The UAP was also comfortable to just spin again and make the next jet flanking shoot its anti missile flares! There was clear distress. The fighters took off together repeating this attack approximately 3 times before taking off in an ear shattering retreat. The UAP sat in the sun a moment longer and seemed to circle the area almost as in a victory lap, it then departed with absolutely no sound in the complete opposite direction as the fighter jets had flown. To be clear when the UAP was stationary and the jets had flown away every time the 3 attempts and the retreat the only clear sound of a airplane was the fighters who seemed to be intercepting this sudden threat. I did not see if the UAP had shot anything I could define as a weapon. And the fact that the dogfight happened almost entirely in the rays of the sun my galaxy s22 ultra was not able to get anything other than a blinding glare and noise  If anyone else was witness to this event we encourage you to file a report.  UPDATE – June 14.    We just spoke with the witness who filed the report, as well as his wife who also viewed the incident.   After reviewing photos of types of military aircraft he able to narrow down the identification of the jets to F-16’s, not F-22’s.   When the F-16s departed, they flew to the south, while the UAP disappeared over the lake.  The witness has military experience and was familiar with aircraft from his time stationed at the 304th Expeditionary Signal Battalion in Korea, where he was trained.   He also added that for 4 days after the sighting the jets returned to the same spot at 10AM, firing flare again on the 4th day.  We have asked the witness to send us a drawing of the UAP, as well as to encourage his friends to submit corroborating reports, which we will post as soon as we receive them.  UPDATE – June 18  Last night we received the following report from the wife of the original witness, who described the event from her vantage point:  While dropping off my camper at Thumb Storage on the morning of June 3rd, 2023, around 10:00 am, I was sitting in my car as my husband unhooked the camper from the truck. Suddenly, the roar of jets filled the air; they were both loud and incredibly fast. As I often do when I hear jets, I watched them carefully.   This time, however, they began to fire flares, circling an object that I spotted emerging from the brilliance of the sun. It’s difficult to describe what I saw accurately, but the object appeared to be a disk-like shape and metallic in color. The peculiar type of metallic hue was blending with the sunlight, making it rather hard to discern.   I called out for my husband, who was already attempting to record the surreal occurrence. The jets continued their circling maneuver around this unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) a few more times, and launched more flares. It seemed as though they were having difficulty tracking the object, perhaps losing it in the sun’s glare.  Remarkably, the UAP was silent, moving in a sort of skipping motion. After they lost sight of it once more, the jets promptly departed.  Media Interest  Several local news sites, as well as Coast to Coast AM, have picked up the story.   Mark Birdsall, assistant editor of the Huron Daily Tribune,  reached out to several air bases to try to to identify where the jets came from, but came up empty.   He did, however, identify several other witnesses who saw the jets and one who also confirmed the UAP.    Read his full article here.   UPDATE – June 22  Linda Mouton Howe has posted an in depth interview with 2 of the witnesses on YouTube.       In the interview there is some discussion that the jets may have been F-35’s rather than F-16’s.    Click here to view the video.    The interview starts at the 5 minute time mark and lasts roughly 20 minutes.  Furthermore, a caller to the hotline has communicated that there are radar tapes he has seen proving the jets were over Bad Axe at the time of the sighting.

In fact, they have a whole squadron of A-10s, which were once used as part of the Tactical Air Command in support of ground troops. These were tank busting aircraft, not fighter jets. The Michigan ANG also operates the MQ-9 Reaper… the remotely piloted drone that we hear so much about in the Middle East. As well, the 127th flies the KC-135T Stratotanker… a refueling aircraft.

For NUFORC it might be worth it to get access to their historical data archive for this sighting and others. While military planes can turn off ADS-B transponders, by law in the US they must have them turned on in Class A airspace.   As an example, during the recent shootdowns following the Chinese spy balloon, military aircraft were tracked on ADSB Exchange in the vicinity to where the operations happened.

As a longtime visitor to this site, obviously this report caught my attention… but it just wasn’t coming together for me.   The flares, as I understand it, are typically used to divert heat-seeking missiles, and suggest that this was some kind of training exercise. As to what the witness described as a circular shaped object, or UAP, that could out maneuver the fighter jets, possibly F-16s, who knows?  Going back to the ’70s, I have a brother who once flew with an Air Force squadron designed to intercept UFOs, as they were formally called. So the military denial regarding involvement with this sighting, in spite of the Pentagon’s new claim to transparency, doesn’t surprise me.

So I grew up with part of this, that is to say I remember when… let’s call him Rob, first flew for Civil Air Transport (CAT) in Southeast Asia, similar to what Air America was doing at the time. By the ’70s he was flying for this unnamed squadron over large parts of the US, and these were research flights. I mean, these were Boeing 707s conducting intelligence flights. I remember the term that these intercepts were “data driven,” electronics, radar, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar, which came along a little later and allowed for three dimensional imagining. But here’s the weird thing, this went on during the ’70s. So how come this new congressional office set up to investigate UAPs isn’t doing anything like this? Have they forgotten about this, or are conveniently unaware of the history? At any rate, I still enjoy a good story; and as for Rob… a lot older but still the company man that he was when he went off to SE Asia for the Agency, which he doesn’t talk much about either. If you want my opinion, the truth is still out there….

Some of them before camera phones some after. I have lived in my current home for 40yrs and I have seen 4 in the air space above my home in that time period. I saw 3 in 2015 about a month apart, I come from a mechanical back ground and I can repair most anything from your car to heavy machinery to your washing machine. I pretty much so know how things work when I see it. The last craft I saw was not made by humans not made here no possible way. If you ever see one you will find yourself looking up alot. All of my sightings were at close range except two all during the daytime except 1. When I see one I am in such awe that I dont want to take my eyes off of it as I am afraid I will miss it hence the reason I have never videoed one of them. I cant wait to see the next one, I look every day.

I never heard of this website, so I didn’t report it until today. If you have Instagram you can see the picture and a video I took. My Instagram is private but request to follow @chris_style_sr and I will accept so you can see it for yourself. They are definitely out here in Michigan and I encourage people to look up a little more often.

It was an extremely bright orange orb just above the treeline.  I noticed it because it was so bright and as I started watching it it turned from one orange light into two lights, like it spit out or divided into two straight up and down. The lights went from two back to one and back to two , several times over the course of a couple minutes. After watching this for like 3 minutes I decided to go inside to get my phone to try and get it on video and bye the time I got back the lights were now below the treeline so I had to try a follow it through the trees with my eyes but after a few minutes of hoping it would come back over the tree tops and back into my sight but it didn’t move back up and I lost it in the trees. Now that Ive seen it I’m determined to get it on video hopefully one of these nights this summer! 							 						 					 				 				 			 				 				 					 						 							 Jennifer  							 																 May 13, 2023 															 Reply 																												 						 						 						 													 							 Many recent reports of multiple slow moving lights that shine for a few seconds and then go out, like circling craft visible on one side of the flight circle. They move from left to right or right to left. They seem to circle in a group in one spot in they sky for minutes to hours at a time. I have been seeing them looking north from my backyard in Arizona and after much research on the internet have concluded that these are flaring Starlink satellites. I read through many of the other reports from this year and last year and there are a lot of other reports matching what I am seeing. Here are links to explain what people are seeing.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8u1GHHz2Ko  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea8BCl2yVU0  PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD about these flaring satellites. 							 						 					 				 				 			 				 				 					 						 							 kent  							 																 May 15, 2023 															 Reply 																												 						 						 						 													 							 I just observed a long line of starlink satellites over Sacramento, California.

We were walking..stargazing..10:20 pm..College City ,CA on college St….perfectly clear night..something..gut feeling made me tell my girlfriend let’s turn around..we turn around and just saw about 20 lights or so in a perfect straight line..even spaced moving slowly..we were in awe..didn’t even think of taking a picture..no noise..no marking lights blinking from a plane or anything..nothing..so I decide to shine my flashlight on them..immediately when I did that they started to faded slowly in succession..from the front one to the back and then they were just gone!! The night sky did not change in brightness it was the same darkness in whole sky at this time so them fading due to horizon light is out of the equation. And these lights were not in space..they were low. They were just cruising slowly and they only faded when they realized I put my flashlight on them. These were not starlink..I did a search on an app that would let you know if they were in your area and it said no. 							 						 					 				 				 			 				 				 					 						 							 Christian Stepien   							 																 May 15, 2023 															 Reply 																												 						 						 						 													 							 What you describe sounds exactly like Starlink, despite what your app said.

The satellites don’t emit their own light, they only reflect the sun’s light. They are only reflecting that light for certain amount of time and then you can’t see them anymore due to the angle of the sat/Earth/Sun configuration. 							 						 					 				 				       			 				 				 					 						 							 kym  							 																 May 31, 2023 															 Reply 																												 						 						 						 													 							 yes, an even line of lights moving slow and in a “sattelite” directions (i.e. from the W, SW or NW) sounds like a sat train. but ive seen others that are a bit different that still likely are sats. e.g. one time i saw maybe a dozen lights come from the sw going to ne (i.e. sat direction). they came 1 by 1 spaced out maybe 1 min apart. All on slightly diff but parallel tracks. Sounds like a spaced out starlink. 🙂 Another time I saw 100s of dots in a band going from SSW to NNE fairly slow. Looked like a purple/blue diamond bracelet. bee-you-tiful! but still some kind of sat train.

Gribble . The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events.   Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 170,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals. The principal means used by the Center to receive sighting reports is this website, which has operated continuously since 1994.   Prior to that period, the telephone hotline and the U.S. mail were the primary means of taking reports.    The Center’s independence from all other UFO related organizations, combined with its long standing policy of guaranteed anonymity to callers, has served to make it perhaps the most popular and widely accepted national UFO reporting facility anywhere.    The website and hotline are well known by law enforcement agencies, FAA ARTCC’s and flight service stations, National Weather Services offices, military facilities, NASA, and many 911 emergency dispatch centers all across the United States and in many parts of Canada. Those entities routinely direct the calls they receive regarding possible UFO sightings to the Center. One of the Center’s policies, which distinguishes its operations from most other UFO organizations, is that it makes available to the public all of its data in summary form. Detailed information is made available to experienced UFO investigators.    The National UFO Reporting Center is a non profit Washington State corporation.  						 				 					 		 							 		 				 						 					 			 								 				 			 /*! elementor - v3.14.0 - 26-06-2023 */.elementor-heading-title{padding:0;margin:0;line-height:1}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title[class*=elementor-size-]>a{color:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-small{font-size:15px}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-medium{font-size:19px}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-large{font-size:29px}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-xl{font-size:39px}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-xxl{font-size:59px} Center Director - Peter Davenport 		 				 				 				 							 Peter Davenport has been director of the National UFO Reporting Center since 1994.  He has also served as the director of investigations for the Washington Chapter of the Mutual UFO Network.   He often presents lectures on specific UFO cases, most notably the Phoenix Lights sighting. Peter has had an active interest in the UFO phenomenon from his early boyhood. He experienced his first UFO sighting over the St. Louis municipal airport in the summer of 1954, and he investigated his first UFO case during the summer of 1965 in Exeter, New Hampshire.  He has also been witness to several subsequent anomalous events, possibly UFO related, including a dramatic sighting over Baja California in February 1990, and several nighttime sightings over Washington State during 1992. Peter received his undergraduate education at Stanford University in California, where he earned bachelor’s degrees in both Russian and biology, as well as a translator’s certificate in Russian translation.   His graduate education was completed at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he earned an M.S. degree in the genetics and biochemistry of fish from the College of Fisheries, as well as an M.B.A. degree in finance and international business from the Graduate School of Business. Peter has worked as a college instructor, a commercial fisherman, a Russian translator in the Soviet Union, a fisheries observer aboard Soviet fishing vessels, a flight instructor, and a businessman. Peter  was the founding president of a Seattle-based biotechnology company, which currently employs over 300 scientists and technicians.   In 1986, Peter was a candidate for the Washington State legislature, and in 1992, he was a candidate for the U. S. House of Representatives.  email:  director@ufocenter.com 						 				 					 		 							 		 				 						 					 			 								 				 			 CTO - Christian Stepien 		 				 				 				 							 Christian Stepien has had a life long interest in UFOs and is an avid student of the phenomenon.

"This is a still shot recently taken from video that I obtained from a siteing that I reported on this website in  2010.    I took this photo with a camera off of the freeze framed video and it has been enlarged.  You are looking at a big craft with two smaller ones to the left side approaching it.  The smaller ones each had two lights.    Full description of the 8 siteings are on this website under Amherst, VA.",

The next step is to secure funding to produce a commercially available unit that anyone can buy and install.

The reports consist of a wide variety of sightings, from structured craft, to lights moving erratically in the sky, to frequent sightings of mysterious orange or blue “orbs”.    Conjunction of Jupiter and Venus  Reports spiked heavily in late February and the first few days of March when Jupiter and Venus appeared just 1/2 degree apart from each other in the western sky, a rare and spectacular astronomical alignment.   Many witnesses mistook this as a single craft, and reported it as such to us both over the …   	 	Continue Reading 1275 New Reports Posted  					 	 																																	 		 			 	 		 The MADAR Project 	   								 Post published: January 25, 2023 																										 Post comments: 2 Comments 			  	   Those of you who diligently scan our reports have likely noticed references to MADAR nodes, for example  this report from May of 2022 .    MADAR stands for Multiple Anomaly Detection and Automated Recording, and these reports document alerts triggered by a network of special sensors placed in strategic locations around the globe.    The sensors are designed to detect electromagnetic and ionospheric disturbances that may be caused by UFOs.  The project is unique in that it uses a scientific approach to collecting data and analyzing it, rather than relying on anecdotal evidence. This has led to a high level of credibility …   	 	Continue Reading The MADAR Project  					 	 																																	 		 			 	 		 1255 New Reports Posted 	   								 Post published: December 22, 2022 																										 Post comments: 12 Comments 			  	 The NUFORC website has been updated as of Thursday December 22, 2022, with the posting of  1255 new UFO sighting reports , submitted to our Center since mid-October of this year.   …   	 	Continue Reading 1255 New Reports Posted  					 	 																																	 		 			 	 		 Multiple Pilot Sightings Over the Midwest 	   								 Post published: November 8, 2022 																										 Post comments: 27 Comments 			  	 REQUEST DIRECTED TO ALL AIRLINE PILOTS AND COCKPIT CREW MEMBERS  On the morning of Monday, November 7th, NUFORC received a seemingly quite credible report from an airline 1 st  Officer, who reported having witnessed, together with the aircraft’s pilot, a very dramatic display of lights over the Midwestern United States during the prior evening.  Moreover, several other flight crews allegedly reported the same event over their backchannel, so-called “guard,” radio frequency, and apparently discussed the event extensively over the course of an estimated 20-25 minutes.  If any person who is reading this advisory statement was witness to a dramatic sighting …   	 	Continue Reading Multiple Pilot Sightings Over the Midwest  					 	 																																	 		 			 	 		 NUFORC Featured in Seattle Times Magazine Article 	   								 Post published: November 2, 2022 																										 Post comments: 0 Comments 			  	 The National UFO Reporting Center was recently visited by Erik Lacitis of the Seattle times, who wrote a nice piece about it for the October 14 edition of Pacific NW Magazine.

"There were three stationary lights, they very quickly disappeared after catching a glimpse of it.  I was walking with a two friends of mine.  We were walking down a road back to one of their house's.  Something caught our attention in the corner of our eyes.  We looked up to get a glimpse of the ""ufo"", and as soon as we saw it, it just disappeared.    It was 2, or 3 orange lights.  It disappeared so quickly, it was hard to tell.  But i know it had to of been a ufo, because of the speed in which it took off after being stationary.   ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report does not indicate the time and date of the sighting.  We have attempted to contact the party, but the telephone number is blocked.  We wonder whether this is intended to be a serious report, or not.  PD))",
"these things are everywhere around here!!!  a friend and i were going to a friends house out in the gillburg community and just happened to be talking about ufo's. my friend stopped at the top of the long driveway which went in between 2 tobacco fields to relieve himself. all of a sudden he starts yelling for me to look outside the car at the sky. what we saw was what looked like a bright star to the left of the driveway. it sat there bobbing around for a few seconds, then stopped.then it shot off atan incalculable speedto thenorth towards henderson. we then proceeded down the driveway to the  house dumbfounded and amazed by what we had just seen. when we got out of the car we looked up at the opposite side of the driveway and saw 3 more objects. these objects were nowhere near where we saw the 1st one.they also stayed in one area. they were making eratic maneuvers. they would go up and down,diagonally, spiral. no human could have withstood tne g-force exerted by the craft.i went in to the house and got the girl who lived there along w/ her 7 yr old son and they witnessed the same thing. i was so amazed that i went next door to a guys house i didn't even know and showed it to him. he was just as amazed as we were.we watched them for awhile and went inside. they were still there 30 min. later when we came out. this isn't the only encounter i have had w/ these objects but it is the only time i have seen more than 1 at the time. i don't know what is going on around here. i'm not the only one seeing this. other people are seeing it too. its just that people around here don't report stuff like that. that isn't the only encounter i've had  hereeither. i've encountered other types of objects that i will write in about later.sometimes , me and a friend will go out on clear nights and look for them. we almost never come home dissapointed. if someone else in this area or anywhere has seen anything similar, e- mail me and tell me about it at ((e-address deleted)). i would love to hear your story.",
"Funny flashing lights that hovered then just dashed up into the sky, near Oscoda in the late summer of 1975.  I was 7 at the time and this is the best I can recall--sorry for the poor answers. I was camping with my indian guide group at a YMCA camp near Oscoda Michigan.  I think the camp was called camp oeasa (I am not sure how it is spelled).  There were about 15 kids and about half as many adults.  most of the adults had gone to sleep, but there were at least one or two on night watch, to keep us kids out of trouble.  We were all in sleeping bags around a camp fire, lying on our backs when I remember seeing a string for flashing lights hovering in the sky, then just shoot up into the stars after about a minute of so.  I do not remember if I saw it and started talking about it, or if someone else noticed it and I looked up.  I remember joking about it with the ohter kids.  It was very strange!  It looked just like a funny string of very funny looking Christmas tree lights flashing.  It was so long ago that I can not even guess how far away, how big, etc...  What ever it was, it did not make any sound that I can recall.  There is a near by Air base and I remember wondering if it was something from there, but I do not know of anything that could have come from Oscoda that might look and behave like that.  But then again who knows?  It is worth reporting anyhow.",

"Strange sighting of huge triangular UFO spotted in Canfield, OH  A few people and I were playing basketball when my 9 year sister spotted a huge bright white object in the shaped of a triangle with some sort of bubble at the front end of it completely stunned of what was flying over us I've never seen such a thing so big and bright but it was completely silent and took of without a trace.    I stared at this object for more than a minute but some how this huge object flew away at least 2,000 mph or more startling me and the other witnesses and our beliefs have changed forever I now know that we are not the only intelligent species and there is in fact other beings beyond us humans.    Would like if Canfield, Ohio, were to be inspected by professionals because I believe this could lead to a new beginning for everyone in our world.",
"Unusual sounds and starlight distortion definitly intellegently controlled.  I was in my room, watching discovery channel when I heard what sounded like a very strong wind.  I looked out my window at the trees lining my street to see them completly calm.  So i thought it might be a jet aircraft and went outside to look.    Upon exiting my home, i realized that the sound wasnt moving.  I started scanning the sky, looking for the sound. It is a clear night out. U can see the whole of the night sky.  Stars from horizon to horizon.  There was no visible jet, or any aircraft that i could see.  I began searching for FAA running light, hoping to use them to locate the source of the sound.  There where no lights anywhere.   I then began trying to use the complete star banket as a means of location.  When an aircraft moves through the night sky, it has to pass under the stars, thereby blocking some out as it moves.  There where no disturbances in the area that the sound was coming from.  As i was about to just go back inside, thinking it was just a high wind off up in the area above the tree line, the sound began to move at a slow but accelerating rate due north.   I again began to use the star light to try and locate the source as it moved.   It was then i saw a weird distortion.  Not a true blocking of starlight.  But more of a moving of the starlight, like it was being forced around something.  As i tried to follow the distortion visually, it accelerated at a phenomenal rate north and both the sound, and distortion disappeared.    I would like to apologize about the condition of this report.  My only access to the internet is a oldish cell phone.    I hope you read this and believe that this is not a hoax, or my imagination as my family seems to think.   I know what i heard, and i know what i saw.    Thank you for your time.",
"they were close to my home, hope they come soon ....im waiting.....  It was dark, clear night with the moon very bright, and I saw an black shaped almost like a boomerang with no lights coming over my house, about 1000 feet up,   Then 2 jets behind it, chasing it, but then just before my eyes it vanished, poof.  Then, the 2 jets turned around and headed west.    Then a day later I filmed a video of a circle shaped orb over my home...loved it .hope to see them soon ....thnks",
"UFO disappears over cirrus formation.  This morning at approximately 10:00, 1-6-2019, I am watching a jet leaving a vapor trail, flying an unusual heading for the area, NW-SE across my city.  Most aircraft come over W to E for Centennial or for Buckley AFB, or SW to NE approaching DIA.  This same heading back and forth is used almost weekly but only by military helicopters.  In tracking its angle of flight, to match on my cell phone compass.  I observe a stationary, first, then, slowly moving, disk-shaped, metal object, catching a glint of the sun flying above the contrail of the jet and into the cirrus clouds where it disappears.  Though it’s above the jet’s trail, it makes no trail itself.  Perhaps a mile behind the jet, it’s about five times the size of the jet that had passed just before on the same heading.  Had it been low enough to have no trail, it would have been audible, based on my experience with various types of aircraft at this location.  It is silent as is the jet.  And if a low prop, it would have been below the contrail, not above it. Its heading is SE-NW, opposite that of the jet.  Turning briefly to reach for my binoculars, I am unable to locate the object for a closer viewing.  I live near several Lockheed-Martin facilities.  UFOs are often seen in this area, though this was my first.",
"The gulf breeze florida sightings were a AC130 from Hurbert field.  My nephew was the navigator and flight weapons control officer.  There was a special secret weapon being tested over the gulf of mexico.  It is a light 80 times brighter than the headlights on a 747.  It was used in the first gulf war.  They flew over the enemy, which were seen on their infrared cameras very late at night.  Then they would put on the light and announce that they would fire, that the enemy was surrounded, to come out and surrender.  Thousands did with no weapons needing to be fired.  As you fly in a circle with all lights on the aircraft out ,just this one light on it appears to be a very bright light that goes from left to right, disappears and then appears again where it started to the left.

Then I went back to sleep as I felt a gentle force near my eyebrows.  I woke up at about 3:00 AM, in an uncomfortable position, to truck sounds, of loading and unloading, coming from my neighbor's house.  When it was day, I told my mom, and she had felt something, at midnight, on her back and breathing in the same area.

"Saw very bright flying object while driving that moved like a helicopter but had no sound & 3 extremely bright lights in triangle shape  I saw an extremely bright light in the distance to the right of the road while driving north on Rt. 19.  I thought it was possibly a light at the tip of a distant gas drilling well, but then it started to move.  It came directly over the road and slowed down.  I noticed that the extremely bright lights looked like they were halogen or xenon.  I slowed down to look closer.  There were 3 distinct large round lights that were in the shape of a triangle.  Thinking it was possibly a rescue or search helicopter, I rolled down the windows but heard no noise.  At that point, I got nervous and stepped on the gas.  It moved south past me above the road, and I could not see it in my rear view mirror.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

"Many years ago I went to relax in my garden and after a few minutes I saw a strange silver object in the sky which had 3 semi-spheres at the bottom consisting of different colours.  This object was extremely large and looked like a ordinary baloon which moved slowly over my house.  But the strange thing was it then moved suddenly, and so quickly, then sped off in the sky.   But I want to say to you that I don't believe in UFOs even if I did see this odd thing.  So my conclusion is it was probably a goverment craft that I don't know about.

"On 4th of May 2021 I was in bed and my partner came to the bedroom at 1:40am he was goung to bed but looked at the window and shout my name and that there is something on the sky.

It was in the same place up in the sky and not moving. We were looking at it and in shock. It was about 5 minutes when I pick up my phone as I realized I should record it. When I put my phone to the window and teied to record it the object turn off the lights immediately and gone. It was as they knew I wanted to record it. I'mvery sceptical, never believed in such a things like ufo and it happened to me first time in my life and I am 43 years old. This thing was seen by me and my partner.",
"I have more than one event to report, but I will do them seperately and chronilogically. The first event I remember occurred in either the summer of 1975 or 1976.  My husband (at the time)and I shared a common interest in things like weather-watching, storm-chasing and skywatching in general.  We had driven to a remote area Southwest of Odessa, Texas to a place on the Caprock that was an excellent skywatching spot.  There are many radio, and television transmitters strung for miles along this caprock.  We had driven to a spot where the line of towers was behind us by probably 5 miles at most.  We were in his small convertible sports car.....an old, tiny mid-engine Porsche.........and we were sitting on the tops of our seats where they met with the frame of the car.  There was no back seat to this car, and it was like a T-top.  I don't remember how long we had been watching the sky, when one of us spotted what at first looked like it might be a satellite...........reminded me of a moving star.  No blinking or twinkling to speak of, no changes in intensity.  We first noticed it in the northwest, and it was moving slowly but steadily. across the sky towards the Southwest.  We became convinced it was a satellite within about 30 seconds, and at this point, it was in the center of our field of vision (almost due West).  If you think in terms of inches, it was about 12 inches above the horizon at that point we came aware of another identical light moving from the Southeast along the same horizontal plane.  We both then began to scan the entire sky almost instinctively, and immediately became aware that there were numerous lights coming from several directions, including directly overhead .  I remember at this point I was extremely excited and we were both shouting expletives and I was saying over and over, Whaat is going on, now.............come on, what the hell is happening and him saying Wait, wait, look over here and oh crap there's another one.  They finally had us convinced that they were going to collide and I remember how intense the feeling was that we were about to witness an explosion of! some ki nd...........but instead, as they got closer to each other, they slowed a bit, all at the same rate, and all stopped instantly, where then you saw what was either six or eight spots of light in a circle, equidistant from each other.  Then they began to flash independently but in an organized sequence that then gave an impression of an octagon or six-pointed star.  It was like if you drew dots on a piece of paper and then connected the dots so that the shape was revealed.  However,  It seemed that the area within the dots was not obscured.  You could see the night sky within the area formed by the dots.  After about maybe 30 seconds to a minute (I have never been sure about how much time went by) they stopped flashing, one at a time, as if each had to complete a sequence, then they were gone for a couple of seconds, then all lit up at once, and began to increase in brightness, and then began to glow red, and then streaked off in all 6 or eight directions, leaving trails that reminded me of meteors on fast-forward  but disappeared before traveling halfway across the sky.  As we sat there with our mouths hanging open, I was crying in wonder more that fear.  About 10 seconds maybe, after they disappeared, we heard what sounded like a sonic boom and a flash that lit up the whole sky for a split second, brightest at the horizon.  Only in retrospect can a say that the flash reminds me of what I have seen in films of nuclear bombs.......the first flash.  I can remember us jumping off the car and each lighting cigarettes and just standing there smoking and looking at the sky and not speaking, me crying.  Then we put the top back on the car and headed home.  I remember the drive from our location to the highway, but I don't remember anything else about getting home.  My next memory was going to work the next day and telling my boss and co-workers about it, and being ridiculed about it for weeks afterward. My ex-husband and I stayed friends and had other skywatching adventures, but only eclipses and meteor showers. I cannot remember us talking about it to each other in anything but a round-about way, except for a couple of times, between the event and when I moved to Tulsa in 1980.  I had very little contact with him from then until 1985, when I had been back in West Texas about a year.  I attempted to ask him about the subject, and he said he didn't remember the details very well.  I sensed an even greater reluctance to discuss it when we talked again about 3 years ago.",
I was laying a hgame on my phone and I looked up out the window and saw 2 disks with flashing lights an I took a picture,
"location spherical blue orb emitting sparkly blue laser beams of a deep blue color.  hovering altitude approx. 500 to below 100 ft.  Position translations of about 1/10 mile accomplished in less than 2 seconds.  position translations did not seem to be inhibited by inertia.  (no deceleration, one smooth move).    best guess the orb was i/3 diameter of moon. orb observed for 20 minutes during which time it made about 6 or 7 'translations'  when it paused it hovered for longer than 5 minutes and blue laser beams were directed downward at mostly shallow angles.  3 of the movements or 'translations' started out smooth but sequenced into 4-5 zig-zags with smooth edges like a sine wave.  when the orb reached the next station it was seen to bob up and down in place then stop.    no sounds accompanied the observation as it would a drone.  the rapid movements observed rule out lighter than air contraptions.   ((NUFORC Note:  No time or date indicated by the source.  We have attempted to contact him, but unsuccessfully.  PD))",
"line of about 10 stars that were moving, the front one disappears and another appears on the back, sometimes stop and go  Went outside @ 0430 and saw a line of stars which I have never seen in the north eastern sky. After a few seconds I noticed they were moving right to left. There were about 10 at a time, and as they were moving the front one would disappear and another would appear at the other end.  Towards the end several would get close together and then separate.  And several would stop and go.  This lasted for several minutes.  Then they disappeared.",
EMS sees line of UFOs traveling two by two.  We just saw strange lights in the sky while responding to a 911 call. They traveled in a straight line and two by two. They were exactly the same length a part. It was nothing I had ever seen before.,

"Strange Gray Disk Hovering then shooting up and disappearing..  Good Morning,  Approximately 7:35am to 7:40am I was alerted by my daughter of something strange in the sky. Followed by my son who ran inside to tell me to come outside.   I looked up into the sky to see a strange gray disc like object that was not moving. Just suspended in the air. I saw some of the kids on the bus get out with their phones up and even the bus driver was looking out of his driver side window. I’m not sure if any of the parents present saw it but at the time my phone was on the charger and my kids had theirs in their pocket.   I’m pretty sure if any of the kids with their phones up were recording it’s likely a TikTok by now or some other form of popular media as they’re all middle school to high school students. The object took off straight up until it disappeared. I have flown in airplanes, crop planes, and helicopters. I own two drones and have some expertise in maneuvers concerning aircraft dynamics, not to say I’m a scientist but I know enough to accurately state that with the knowledge I have now that no air craft can move that fast going upwards and disappear in literal seconds.   Also, the way this gray disc was hovering made me think it could be spinning slowly, may had some propulsion from either side. The skies are completely blue with hardly any clouds and the fact it didn’t have wings and remained stationary in the air seems suspect for a craft re-entering Earth’s atmosphere and is not a balloon or other helium or gas powered object. This was perfectly still except for the small side to side swaying that was almost too precise to be called anything other than stabilizing in the jet stream.   The fact the craft or whatever it was had been able to shoot straight up without moving forward, backwards, or to the side seems impractical. I cannot think of anything else that I know about which can achieve rapid acceleration almost as if breaching the stratosphere and into what I can only speculate is outer space.   I called the local non emergency line and was told I’m not the first to report it but it’s likely a military craft or a science project from something.   I don’t know what else to say about this except I am confused and confounded by what I saw.  What all of us witnessed, honestly. Wish I could be of more assistance.",
Four of us sitting on our front porch enjoying the evening before bed out of nowhere we see this long line of straight white lights not flashing probably look maybe a hundred feet in length and seemed like it was just floating all of a sudden it seemed like it tried to turn and just disappeared not like it shot off and disappeared but just went invisible. Also it was silent not one single noise with this line of lights and they were white non-flashing,
"Tic tac in background of photo  Daytime, afternoon/midday. Looked at a photo we just took. Saw tic tac in background partially in/near the clouds. Not in photo immediately before or after. Both have photo experience. NOT a lighting/exposure issue. I don’t believe most photos of UAPs are real but I think this WAS something. Have no idea if time was weird, we weren’t keeping track. Asked him if he still has photo, says he doesn’t know (he’s a photographer and doesn’t save them all if he has a better version in the series). I would have reported it earlier and with the photo but I just found out your resource existed today. Don’t know if there were electrical disturbances. We didn’t check. Weather disturbances on and off that week while camping there. Silvery or light color. Looked like a classic tic tac based on other photos I’ve seen. Used to be more of a skeptic but was open to the possibility of it. This photo always seemed to have something real in it to me. Will send photo if my ex can find it.",
IFO - StarLink satellite train  Thought I would provide an IFO report since you will likely get some reports on this.  Observed StarLink train of satellites approx 1920h cross WNW to E relative to Pilot Butte at approximately 30 deg alt to horizon.   The train per se spanned about 10 degrees (closed fist width at arms length).  Much brighter than reference stars in Ursa Major that it passed below.  An amazing sight and I can see why folks who don’t know what they are would think it was a UFO armada.,
"3 Orbs Planted in the sky like stars but upon video taping were multi colored changing shapes  I've seen these same objects multiple days in a row at the D Street Beach in Encinitas, CA, although most of the other nights it was only one of these multi-light shifting orbs, when last night I spotted 3. The three I eventually spotted were rather far out over the ocean—a few miles and were arranged in a perfect equilateral triangle with the apex the furthest out over the ocean. On other days I've had different friends who also witnessed the object(s) which have looked very similar—a brightly lit, multi-color orb that hovers and sometimes changes in shape, sometimes expands and contracts. And sometimes it is moving up the coast like a bright light. Before last night, 5/4/21, for the last 10 days, I had noticed only one of these orbs but in the same location, near where the star Sirius in the western night sky, which is also near the constellation Orion. The orb appears planted in the sky at about the same height as the normal flight path of the military he! licopters, or maybe a little higher, (which are out patrolling every single night) but the orbs were unmoving and almost disguised as a star. For a long time I didn’t notice it because it looked just like a brightly lit star but upon videotaping, it clearly is not a star. I've also videotaped it with helicopters flying past it, too, and it is definitely different than the helicopters. I've witnessed these orbs on different occasions off the coast of San Diego over the ocean, infrequently now for about a year, sometimes playing with the military, sometimes being followed by them, and sometimes much closer than they were last night, but haven’t made any reports until now. But now the frequency has changed dramatically as they have shown up every night. Last night the orbs were just planted in the sky and the military helicopters were ignoring them. The strange thing is how long they seem to just be planted there without moving—far longer than a helicopter or a drone can hover! , totally without sound, and the strangest part was that they’! ve been planted there for many days in a row. I start to notice them just as the sky gets dark enough. Unfortunately all of my videos are shaky and don’t show the way the orbs are just planted in the sky but the colors of the objects are dancing and shifting—you can see that much. I’ve ordered a new lens and tripod for my camera phone to continue collecting data which is very shocking to me. I was a big skeptic about all of this until I had other witnesses confirm. I fully expect them to be there again tonight. They have stayed in place without moving until I got tired and went home for the evening all of these nights. Last night I don’t recall missing time but I have had contact experiences in the past. The beach here where I live is very quiet and dark and private with tall hundred foot bluffs behind me. I generally watch the sunset on the beach every night and started seeing strange lights a year ago but for a long time believed it was just the military until some very strange th! ings happened—like the orbs sometimes shoot across the sky. I also saw a recent display of 4 or 5 of them together fading in and out disappearing and have that on video as well.",
"Multiple lights that contracted then retracted into one then disappeared.  At about 9:00pm on May 4th, my boyfriend and I decided to walk to the store.  While walking I happened to look up and we saw about 15 or so lights that were in a straight line contracting moving away from each other then shortly after retracted and disappeared.   They stayed in a straight line and the best way of describing it was like a coil or slinky being stretched.  As the line formation contracted the lights grew further apart yet held in line formation and at the end before disappearing they retracted coming back together as one and then disappeared.  Both of us tried taking video and pictures with our phones and were both strangely unable to as both froze...  Strangest yet most intriguing thing I’ve ever seen!",
"On 5/24/21 just after dusk, with last light on a cloudless Western sky, I was taking my dog on our nightly walk around my neighborhood, and just as I finished, while standing in front of my drveway looking West saw a string of lights coming toward me out of the Western horizon. I thought it remarkable as so many lights where in a precise straight line, and moving very fast, that I continued to watch as it flew directly over head.   The lights appeared to be broken up into separate distinct lights, like you would expect from an airplane window with solid spaces between the lights, but in an irregular pattern. I see airplanes and jets all day and nights around here (I'm near an airport), but it looked nothing like any plane I have ever seen. As it was directly over head I specifically listened for any sound and heard nothing. I looked to see if there was a body to the object,then noticed the line of lights was preceded and followed by a couple of ligths in the same straight line formation as the others, but separated by a lenghtly distance.  The overall length was huge, way to big for any commercial jetliner, and flying to low to not be making a very loud noise; I estimate it's altitude was about 2,500 ft. high. I watched as it flew in a straight line eastward until it flew out of sight. Very bizzare.  I have piloted private airplanes with my father since I was 15, and have lived in the area of Paine Fie! ld for approx. 35 years., travelling in commercial airplanes and jets of all sizes over the last 40 years, and have never before seen anything the likes of what I saw tonight.",
"Series of lights seen while stargazing,  possible UFO the length of the Hindenburg.  As I was stargazing outside at 21:25 I saw a series of closely connected lights pass silently and smoothly over the neighborhood traveling West to East. It was visible to me for about 25 seconds but was already halfway through the sky before I noticed it. I first thought it was a shooting star but realized it was a series of individual lights, and positioned as if they were along the sides of a very long aircraft. The only aircraft I could imagine would travel like this (regarding size and flight pattern) would be a blimp the length of the Hindenburg.",
"A distinct, tight stream of colored lights (18+) in a straight line moving slowly across sky-definitely not planes-Never seen before  Seen over the area of Lebanon, Oregon, moving from west to east—a stream of bright lights traveling relatively slowly in a straight line with a white “head” and a tight straight stream of distinct, (at least 18) various colored lights (about 2 “fingers” long) following behind—high in the sky but lower than a high flying jet. Clear sky. No evidence of any flaring out like a rocket reentering the atmosphere and the lights did not separate out. The lights appeared to be all connected in a straight line. Two witnesses watched for about 3 minutes from the time we first saw them until they passed out of sight. In our many years of sky watching my Coast Guard veteran husband and I have never seen anything like it! I am a retired College employee with a longtime interest in astronomy.",

"I was taking out my trash for the following morning and saw this florescent cylinder shaped craft hovering above our home, I called to my wife who came running out barefoot, she saw it as well.  Soon after...poof it was dimming and was gone.  Shortly after, we saw several smaller objects one was doing this zig zag maneuver and the others were just flying through the area.  My wife who has been a long time skeptic, could not believe what she was seeing. Must say...she is now a believer. Vic G",
"Row of lights moving together silently through the sky  On Tuesday, May 4, 2021, at approximately 9:30pm, my partner and I were outside enjoying a fire in our fire pit when I noticed very strange lights out of the corner of my eye. We both then looked up and saw a row of lights floating through the sky. There were many small lights moving together, all a part of one object silently moving through the sky. The lights were not in an even pattern and were steady as it moved through the sky. My partner and I ran to the front of the house to continue watching it as it moved. It passed over the nearby hill and disappeared into the darkness, as if designed to easily blend in at night.   My camera on my phone was not strong enough to pick up the lights, but my partner’s phone was. The image does not show the details of all of the little lights as it looks like a more solid ray of light, but the image does show that there may have been more there than what was visible to the eye. In the photo, you can see a difference in the coloring above the lights, as if coming up to a point. This leads me to believe that the lights were along the edge of the object, flat underneath, and domed to a point on the top.",
"At about 9:25 PM over West Vancouver, I observed what appeared to be a long tube or cylindrical shaped object flying at an angle towards the southeast as it disappeared over the rooftops of some houses. I noticed it against the darkening night sky, it had no lights and made no sound. I attempted to follow it in my car but lost sight of it after it disappeared over the houses.  I have never seen anything like it before.",
"White unblinking lights in long line, straight formation, no sound, slow steady speed in straight line moving west to east",
"On Tuesday, May 4th at 21:50 hours, I saw a string of lights in an absolute straight line flying silently across the sky from West to East.  They went about as fast as a passenger jet and appeared to be at about 10,000 feet. They covered a very long area. As it went farther east, it disappeared all at once. I watched from my deck for several minutes.  When I talked to the gentleman at the UFO Reporting Center, he thought that it was most probably Elon Musks Starlight project.  I had never seen this phenomenon before.",
"Fireballs in the night sky  I am a police dispatcher and on my night off I observed several objects rising in the sky. The first appeared as one then split into two, followed by a third. They moved quickly in a southeast direction. Around 5 minutes later, 3 more rose and went into a southeast direction as well. 4 more came up and went in a southeast direction. That occurred all within about 10 minutes of each other. At 22:14, 5 more came up and went in a southeast direction as well. They appeared to have a flickering light almost appearing as though it was a flame or fireball. They were round, disc shaped in a white or light silver color but it was reflective as you could see their flickering lights reflecting on them. There were several witnesses to this as well as people running in the street to record and see as well as several vehicles driving in the area to see if we could find where they were coming from. They all disappeared in the southeast sky. There was absolutely no sound to! these discs but could be seen very clearly that they weren't drones or planes etc. Several pictures and videos were taken but certainly do not show the detail that could be seen in person.",

"A series of lights moving in a line through the NW sky slow and low.  No noise, evenly spaced, White light.  A bit past 2100hrs, 5 May 2021, lasted approx. 20 min.  A series of lights appearing in a line from 10:00 traveling to 2:00 o'clock position across North Star.  20 degrees above the horizon.  The lights appeared in a black section of the sky traveling to the NE in a line very evenly spaced, slow speed, single file, to the 2 o'clock position where they each disappeared one at a time - as they had appeared - in a black section of the sky.  Each was visible for 15 seconds, 10 to 12 visible at any one time and this lasted for about 15 minutes.  As they reached the center of their travel distance they brightened and a cone of light pointed in our direction brightened for 1 or 2 seconds.  Then became the point of light they were at the beginning and end.  When looking at those coming into view the distance they were visible at the other end was extended about 3 or 4 objects/lights.  Looking directly at them the fainter points were lost.  There was no sound.  Brigh! t white point of light in each case.",
"Starlight objects moving rapidly in a straight line across the sky.  I went outside to watch for meteors at approximately 4:40 am. As I looked straight up I observed a train of starlight objects travelling in a straight line coming from the northwest and heading southeast directly towards the moon. Some were closer together than others but all were in a straight line and moving very fast across the sky. I went inside to grab my phone in time to try to photograph them. I counted the last 20 of them as they disappeared into the moonlight, but there was at least that many more before I ran back into the house to get my phone. I've never seen anything like that before.",
"T-shaped white light silently zoomed across horizon then stopped on a dime, with a red halo appearing and disappearing  At 2:15 am, July 5th, I stepped outside on our back deck to smoke and observed an incredibly bright, and fast moving lowercase t-shaped white light traveling across the horizon.   It was already at a quick speed by the time I initially viewed it. Traveling West to East, it was far brighter and faster than a satellite, and the same would hold true for an airplane.   It struck me as an odd time to launch a rocket, given how many people were blowing off fireworks that night, however, after watching filmed rocket launches several times this year while researching Spacex’s Starlink launches, Blue Origin, and Rocketlab launches, I felt like I was probably watching a night time rocket launch.   The only two or three peculiar things were that it was completely silent, although I could easily have been watching something that was 400 miles away, because of how light travels, and I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference; and it didn’t leave an exhaust plume.   However it was nighttime, and its absolutely possible that the exhaust plume wasn’t visible in the night sky, nor at a relative height to be able to reflect light off of the sun. Hell, if I could do the math, that probably wouldn’t even be an option.   Regardless, I watch the light zoom all the way across the horizon in about 90 seconds, saying to myself’ “What a treat, this is amazing!” The horizontal line of the t shape had become significantly stretched out, while the vertical line, from my position, stayed equal length to what it originally was.   It’s about to go behind the tree line, so I sprint from the back deck, through the house, and out the front door to hide behind the car and watch this weird light continue on its path across the horizon.   I’m scratching my head, when the light just stops moving abruptly. I watch it become enveloped by clouds, but it has an immensely striking lightness shining through the cloud. There were 3 or 4 visible stars in the initially cloudless, and now nearly entirely cloud-covered night sky.   Western Washington has very fast changing weather and variability in in vapor pressure, but what really struck me was how bright the still light was behind the clouds. Far brighter than the moon. So significantly brighter than the stars I really had to wonder about it.   I observe the abruptly still white light dim completely away, and then like how a lighthouse light becomes visible in the mist as it spins around back into view, the light went back to full luminosity in exactly the same still position, although this time with a red ring around it. Both of which eventually diminish into blank, dark nighttime sky.   At the bar a few days later, while discussing the bizarreness of the experience with the bartender, a young man of about 30-35 entered the conversation and told me he worked for a subsidiary of Raytheon, shooting 1-30 mHz waves into the clouds in order to gather data on encrypted messaging information, and told me his work schedule had been delayed by a series or prototypical rocket launches being carried out under Amazon’s Project Kuiper, from the Seattle area.   He believed I witness first stage booster separation, ignition of the second stage engine, and simultaneous  reignition of the first stage booster as it was landed back in the greater Seattle Area, giving greater possibility to why I watched the light stop midair, disappear, and then reappear with a red halo, then decrescendo into darkness.   Now, whether or not that is the answer, which I feel is on pretty slim evidence, given that launch schedules are planned out years in advance, and I couldn’t find any corroborating evidence to say that Project Kuiper has already done prototype launches, I still am holding out strong feelings for a government-related, man-made object to be the explation for this.   I’ve spent a significant amount of time researching orbital reentry as well, and although it doesn’t exhibit the typical characteristics of boosters or rockets breaking up on reentry, I did find info on possible entry times of a Chinese-based Long March rocket, CZ-2F that was predicted to re-enter above Washington state within 4 days of of my t-shaped light observation, with a plus or minus of 26 hours. However there were no reported sightings of the re-entry, so its possible it may have been slightly miscalculated.   I’ve also considered the possibility of it being a Navy-related government drone, given that I live within 5 miles of a nationally used Navy Base, although that would be one hell of a light they threw on that sucker.   I’ve sort of ruled out a really long lasting firework, given that I used to make the stars (the expanding or fast moving colored lights) that go inside or mortar fireworks. There are compounds like titanium or magnesium that can give that long lasting exhaust flare, but there is always a smoke trail to accompany it. And I’ve also never seen a firework trail last longer than about thirty seconds at the very max.   Your guess is as good as mine.",
"Around 4:30 AM I went to walk the dog.After sometime I looked up to see if I could find any Aquarid meteors. Instead I saw small orbs of light in a row, about 10 the first group flying by following each other, west to east. No apparent sound. A little while later another group, larger the the first, probably 20-30 flew over. All in a row, except for 3 that formed a triangle as the flew by. Not sure if satellites travel like this in a sort of beaded string and I thought meteors looked like they were falling and emitted a trail of light  These definitely looked like they were going somewhere and there was no light trail.I wanted to take a video but didn't think my phone camera could pick it up well. They were very small orbs of light in the sky.",
Trail of 60+ lights traveling in a line without sound in close linear formation- not visible on cameras  At 4:45 AM this morning I saw a line of 10 lights that looked like super bright satellites but they were moving in a straight line going south east towards San Luis Obispo. I was in los Osos and thought that was odd and waited a minute and then saw another line of them and went to wake up my wife. Then we watched a line of 50 or 60 of the same kind of bright lights without sound moving south east in line in close formation at a steady speed going from the coast towards San Luis Obispo down los Osos Valley. The cameras wouldn’t capture the trail of lights.,

"Flying Garbage Can?????  Not to sure I should be doing this. People gonna think I’m crazy but I have to tell someone. I was out fishing in my kayak and I seen something that caught my eyes. It was above me for a few seconds then it went towards the north. Almost as fast as a blink. What I saw was something strange. It looked like a galvanized tin garbage can. It appeared to only be the size of a small car but it was fast as hell when it shot straight up out of view. Almost like it knew I was watching.  Unfortunately there was no lights, sounds, or any little green men but it kinda freaked me out. This isn’t spam, or a joke. The metal on the aircraft was bright like stainless steel.

I never believed in UFO's or ever imagined I'd ever see anything like that-It wasn't even in the realm of my mind. I was the harshest critic of UFO's in the world.   But, one nite, I was out on my patio on a moonless nite, having my cocktail, & just happened to glance up & see 3 oval/egg-shaped lights rapidly passing overhead, without a sound.   They did not shine light out from them, but had a sort of self-contained light.   One light in front, with another light behind & outward from the the lead light, so as to make a triangular configuration.   Never a sound made. Because the nite was moonless, I was hampered in getting any perspective or depth-conception about how high this thing/these things were, but I could not ascertain any signs that these lights were part of a larger craft or crafts, but I could not swear otherwise.   I was instantly stricken with the notion that this thing was completely unlike anything I'd ever seen in my life.   It had to be at least a couple hundred feet high, but probably a least a couple thousand feet high, & it streaked off, in this formation or whatever, right across the salt-ponds & I could see it heading straight off the coast of Key West, heading in the direction of Cuba.   I sat down in my chair & uttered a couple of ugly oaths, because I knew I'd seen something I didn't want to see & I didn't want to be lumped with those trailer rednecks who see UFO crap down in their pastures.  I sat there & poured myself another drink & tried to run down the litany of everything I could think of to convince myself that I hadn't seen what I'd seen, but I just couldn't con myself that way.  Naturally, it had no red or green or white running lights that aircraft have, that was one of the first things that I had subconsciencouly looked for but failed to see, that & the fact that the sucker was as silent as a ghost.  I still see it in my mind to this day & could paint it, it's so branded in my head.   ((NUFORC Note:  No date provided by witness, who also provides no contact information.

"BOTH TIEMS OCCUR IN SPRING  SUMMER MONTHS.  IN 1980 MY FAMILY AND I WAS TRAVELING DOWN ROUTE 1 FROM CHARLESTOWN TO WESTERLY, RIGHT NEAR THE AIRPORT, HOVERING VERY LOW JUST OVER THE TREES,CLOSER TO THE WATER WERE TWO OBJECTS.  AT FIRST MY FATHER SAID THEY ARE JUST PLANES.  AS ME AND MY BROTHER SCREAMED, MY FATHER LOOKED UP AND REALIZED THEY WERE NOT.   OUT OF SHOCK, HE PULLED THE CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THEY LINGERED, AND THE NEXT THING WE KNEW THEY WERE GONE.    THEY WERE SILVER DISCS ALMOST,LIKE ALUMINUM FOIL COLOR, AND LONG FLAT DISC OVAL SHAPED.  tHINKING BACK, THEY SEEMED VERY LARGE AS A CHILD, AND IT WAS AT SUNSET.  THEY ALMOST LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE LIT UP FROM THE INSIDE, FOR WE COULD CLEARLY SEE THEM AS IT WAS GETTTING DARK.  tHEY WERE PROBABLY ABOUT 200 OR 300 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND, VERY CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT.  THEY CAME FROM BEHIND US, WHICH WAS FROM NEWPORT DIRECTION TOWARD WESTERLY.  EVER SINCE THEN WHEN I VISIT MY PARENTS, I SIT OUT ON THE DECK AT NIGHT, AND USE A TELESCOPE AND LOOK TOWARDS NEWPORT.  I SWEAR I HAVE SEEN THEM, BUT DO NOT TELL PEOPLE.  PRESENTLY I ALWAYS SEE 3, FLYING VERY CLOSE TOGETHER, BOBBING UP AND DOWN, REAL HIGH, AND FAR AWAY, MY GUESS VERY CLOSE TO NEWPORT OR BLOCK ISLAND, IT SEEMS THEY ARE ABOVE THE OCEAN AT LEAST 2000 FEET. I QUESTION IF THEY CAN SEE ME, BECAUSE, AS SOON AS LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION, THEY SPLIT APART, THEN MOMENTS LATER THE 3 SAUCERS ARE CLOSE TOGETHER AGAIN.   I TRULY QUESTION IF SOMETHING IS GOING ON AT THE NAVY BASE IN NEWPORT RHODE ISLAND, AND IN GROTON, CONNECTICUT.   ISN'T IT A COINCIDENCE, THAT BOTH NAVAL BASES ARE CLOSE BY AND SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD SIGHTINGS.ALSO, WHEN I LOOK AT THEM FROM A DISTANCE, THEY SEEM TO BE LIT UP,SAME SHAPE, BUT L IT LIKE LIGHT BULBS BOBBING UP AND DOWN.

"Fast UFO flyies across mountain areas.  Telsa Power???

This wasn't a big deal, untill he saw 2 fighter planes come zooming after it minutes later, their speeds were much slower.  A few days later, the newspaper had sightings of a U.F.O.

It happened when I was playing pool at friend house.    Relatives of my friend were outside and told us to come out a look outside.   When I looked up I saw a brilliant flourescent orange light moving toward us at a very slow speed.  It was about 5 miles away and moving toward our direction at about 2 thousand feet above.  As slowly moved toward where we were (within about a 1/4 mile.  I noticed it didn't have any sound to it even though it exibited amazing characteristics.    It started to glow violently brighter and brighter.  It driped something on fire (molten metal?) that burnt out before it reached the ground.  It slowly started to climb in altitude.  Then all the sudden it shot straigt up at faster than light speed.

PD))  Dream spaceship long years ago, same direction as the comet from some month ago!  I was looking an UFO Report on tv today and I remembered me of a dream that was somewhat realistic that I sould tell you. Sorry for my bad english language, but the dream might be interesting to some of you. Some years ago, I had a somewhat realistic dream. I do not tell you my name or other things, because i just want to report. I looked out of my window in the night. The night was clear, I could see the stars. It was silence. I could see a group of space-ships flying to the earth, they were slow, not fast. And there was no light or something, they all where brown/grey. It was a gigantic formation with houndrets of ships  coming directly out of the sky to the earth. It was looking as they would directly fly to my window, it was gigantic. I could hear nothing, it was completely silent everywhere. No engines, nothing. And they were moving very slow. The formation was as long as i could see, approx one or two ships in a group, then the next formation. Like a small street, but very long, as long as you could see. I remember that the front side of the ships where with red lights and yellow within the light. But only the front site, i could not see a ship from behind. I could not move myself or do anything, i was looking and i can´t move myself. It was unbelievable. Then, i am not sure, because it was long time ago when I had this dream, I think that they startet to shoot, but then i waked up. I am not sure if they really where shooting, i can not remember this. But i can remember the formation in the dream as if i dreamed this dream yesterday, but it must be 10 years ago. A dream is a dream, but this was unbeleavable realistic. I felt the same feeling as wheere a comet some years ago flew in the near of the earth where you could see something if the comet in the sky. exatcly on the same position of my house i had the dream of the direction of the space ships. Again sorry for my bad english.. however.. in the dream the location of the space shipts was the same as i could see the comet flying in the near of the earth some time ago, i forgot the name of the comet but we all could see it. It was the same location! So i think that the ships will come from this direction, too if the dream will come true. This dream *is* true. There was no strange light except the red light, and it was somewhat silent... and gigantic, as if your days are counted. I am living in germany near cologne. Thats all. Someone unknown",
"Between the mid 1950's and mid 1970's I have observed what could be described as UFO phenomena on at least four different occasions.  All these were remarkably DIFFERENT in nature and all were observed in the company of witnesses.  I first thought about reporting them to someone when I came across the Lemon Grove(CA) (sighting/landing?) description from the 70's on the Internet.  Apparently, a youth was the witness to that actual incident but I had overheard a conversation about it taking place in a coffee shop between members of the Lemon Grove Sheriff's Department within a month or so and it had peaked my curiosity since the landing had apparently been sighted in the BACK YARD of the house I had occupied for a number of years and had only RECENTLY left.    A lenghty experience with lights, one to three in number had taken place during the same period lasting for over a week.  I never followed up looking into the (landing) report.

"((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous source.  No dates provided.  PD))  Sightings of Cube, Triangle, Cigar, Diamond  ships over Winchester Massachusetts (near Boston)  I have seen several objects which I believe may be UFO's.  I live on the flight path into Logan Airport in Boston and observe normal aircraft all the time on approach and take-off.   I also live near Hanscom Air Force Base and have observed military planes landing and taking off.  In the past few years I have been stargazing, when all of the sudden, some very bright objects high up in the sky will appear and seem to hover over the Boston area in the sky for a couple of hours.  I observed one of these objects very closely once for a few hours before it seemed to move away.  I used binoculars for a better look. The objects were very bright and very slow moving, but I could tell that they were moving slowly back and forth all over the sky.  It took several minutes for the object to cross the sky.  Then it would change corse and move a different direction for a while.  I looked through the binoculars and also when I squinted my eyes I could make out a triangular shape to the  bright object, and I thought with the binoculars I could make out some flashing lights on the ends of the points of the triangle and even a brightly lit cockpit area. (the object was small and very bright as if it was high up above the earth) Well above the aircraft routes.  It seemed to be observing us.  I have since taken more notice to the skies than in the past and have noticed several times some diamond and triangular objects and even a cube and cigar shape once.  They are all very high up but below the stars and above the planes.  They all move very slowly - and I do not know how to explain it.  But the object is too far away to be a plane and doesn't move fast enough, and too big from the viewpoint to be a star.  The fact that it moves slowly across the horizon and shifts position occasionally rules out that it is a star or planet. I do not know how to explain it except its a UFO.  All of these sightings in the past few years have been in winchester from my house.  But I did also see a cigar shape object with flashing multicolored lights pass overhead in Cooperstown New York.  It was the oddest thing I have ever seen.  And this one actually changed speed.  It moved slowy at first picked up speed, shifted positions, then finally sped off.  But it was moving much faster than a plane or military jet and was too high to be a plane.  And too bright and large to be a star/planet.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates no date.  PD))",

"Only the edges of the craft were visible the center/body of the craft seemed to project a live image of the sky above it, it was silent  127 am...the movement of contrails caught my eye, it was a very clear night. All that was visible was a perfect triangle outline like an 8 ball rack floating across the sky, the inner part appeared to be the sky above it, but there was something just slightly off enough that I could follow it. It seemed as though it's initial visibility was a result of it slowing down. The majority of it's movement appeared fluid, then it seemed to skip forward at varying speeds and distances....it was as though at times it disappeared and reappeared directly in front of itself. The altitude and therefore size of the craft is very difficult to determine, not sure if the contrails that created the visible outline really were actual contrails or just appeared to be because that's my familiar reference point for what I saw, and I couldn't compute that a craft that large from my perspective could be anywhere near high enough to create contrails, but that is what they looked like...they dissipated almost instantly .5 to 1.5 second median range of duration. The craft was ABSOLUTELY silent as well so i couldn't get any help pinging it with my ears either. After further review, I believe the craft was 1500 feet up, give or take, and it was larger than a C5 or C17 which routinely fly over at similar or lower altitude. It approached from SE headed NW. The speed of the craft was either way too slow for anything that big or way too fast for anything that big take your pick, it was doing 150 knots give or take when i first spotted it as it slowed down to maybe 20 knots. When it finally accelerated out of my view its acceleration rate made it invisible instantaneously.",

March 1, 2022, Huntsville, Ala., afternoon before dark….a friend told me to come outside and look at an object, I did and it was about 50 yards away, just above the trees. It moved to my left about 50 yards and stopped. This object looked about the size of a VW bug car, it was dark inside an orange ball shape light. As I watched this, another one, looking the same flew up to this one, they were about three houses away. Then one went to the front of my house and I went to and out my front door to look, it was at the end of my street and not moving. This one went back, next to the other one and after about 5 min., they both, side by side went east till they went out of sight. This was seen for about 30 min. The dark part inside the orange ball had the shape of a top. My friend took digital video of the two objects flying side by side and they were close enough to hear any type of motor…they were silent. The reason I tell you about this is that last night, around 9 pm I saw a similar sight…first one then a couple of mins. behind another one. These were going in the same direction but higher up and about a thousand ft. away, close enough to hear yet again…silent. To let you know, I see all manner of flying craft daily and nightly yet these are the only craft to fly silently seen to date. Thanks for your time.",
Large triangular shaped object over nellis air force base  On the evening of March 1st I was driving north up nellis Blvd .in north las Vegas heading home .I got up to the entrance to my apartment complex when I looked up in the sky .just over the nellis air force base I noticed a large triangular formation of 4 white light objects . stationary in the sky the size of a football field maybe bigger .I pulled off the road into a store parking lot and watched .there were three objects that had formed a triangle shape the fourth object just hovered at the top point of the triangle.the two lower points of the triangle rose up to meet the other two lights and blinked out .along with the fourth white light object.the object that created the top point of the triangle shape .then proceeded to slowly move in a north east direction.after about a minute the other objects. Blinked back into view they were alot closer together all four objects made no noise what so ever,
Every night I see a large orange ball of light with 2 to 3 smaller blue balls of light.  These balls of lights are between 2 major airports. Because of this I don’t believe drones are allowed in the air space. I have not heard nor read anything about these lights. One night I drove out to the bay to try and get a better look with binoculars and I could have sworn I saw things coming out of these orbs. I don’t drink or do drugs. It’s something I can’t really explain.  I would like to be contacted via e-mail only.,
Saw triangle craft with lights all around flying slow and low.  I was looking at the stars when I got home from work. As I was scanning the clear sky I saw what I thought was a flock of birds. As I continued to look I noticed it was not birds and it was a low flying ufo craft. It was triangle shaped and had lights all around it. It looked to be see through but I could also see the craft. It was right above my house and scared me to where I ran for my porch. I walked back to continued watching as it slowly kept gliding by off into the distance. It was getting higher as is got further. I tried to take photo and video but I do not see anything in them.,
"I was driving to Atlanta to work one morning south on I-85 and looked up and saw a Tic-tac style UFO. It was flying near a large airli  I was driving to work one morning about 7:30 AM, driving South on I-85. I looked up in the sky toward my right and saw a Tic-Tic style of aircraff. It was flying not far from a passenger airplane. I watched for a few seconds as I was driving, and looked back at the sky and the Tic Tac had disappeared, but the plane was still flying. The next day I called my son, who had been an active Marine and asked him if we had a flying machine that had no visible means of flight. He said he didn’t know, didn’t think so. I also asked him how this cigar looking flying object could fly with no wings and no engines? He said he didn’t know. And I didn’t know either. After that I heard about the Tic Tac style of UFO’s and realized that was exactly what I had seen in the sky that day. It looked sort of white, but I realized it could have been metallic with the sun shing on it reflecting a white look to it.",
"Ball of light accelerating overhead into the distance  I was sitting in my car waiting for the grocery store to open early in the morning. It was still dark out though.  I then noticed a ball of light moving away from me through my front window. It was about half the diameter of the moon and appeared to be between 200 and 500ft above ground. It was also extremely bright. It accelerated directly into the distance, it appeared to cover several miles in a fraction of a second before dissappearing. It moved in a straight line and seemed to be accelerating. I had visual for only a few seconds.",
Oval object in sky on double aa hugest before you get to Grayson  We were driving and see a oval object shining in the sky that we originally thought was a star but was too early for the time. As we got closer we seen an object silver in color with a small circle of smoke behind it. No stream of smoke but circle smoke it was going faster than a jet straight then lifted up into the clear blue sky and disappeared.,
While waiting for a locksmith I observed an object in the sky above town. I took photographs of the object  I was waiting for a locksmith to come and unlock a vehicle for some people. I was sitting in my patrol car and observed an object in the sky towards the southeast of me. I stared at the object for a few seconds and realized it was not moving whatsoever. I took out my phone and began to take photographs of the object and zoomed in on the object. in the middle of taking photographs the object just vanished. The object appeared dark in color and looked to be a cylinder with a smaller portion sticking out of the bottom of it. When looking at the photographs it appeared as though there was some type of glow around the object.,
Driving to work and saw bright light slow moving craft appear and then imidietly vanish  Driving to work with a co worker and he noticed a light we looked up and saw a cone/ guitar pick shaped object then a couple seconds later it vanished. Not faded not flew away just poof gone,
"Heard a high pitched ringing and turned around to see a shiny, silver space craft.  Was out for a walk after a long day. Started hearing an extremely high pitched and continuous sound. Thought it might be from my migraine, but it wouldn't go away, and seemed like it was coming from above/behind me. I finally turned around after 4/5 minutes and saw a silver spacecraft, big enough to recognise as a spaceship of some sort, but still far away. It had this strange silvery haze around it as well, that was almost beautiful. I was frozen there for a few minutes, and unfortunately didn't think to get video evidence. I was still confused and kind of scared, so decided to just go home and get some sleep. Sorry if it seems like a stupid thing to do, but I was very tired and wasn't 100% that I was seeing what I thought I was. (Though now I am sure of what I saw.) About to turn in early for the night, but wanted to get this off my chest first. Thank you for listening. If I see the spacecraft again, I will submit another report.",

"2 craft locked in tight side by side formation round shape I was using night vision  On the early evening of March 2nd 2022 an elderly man with Dementia went missing on around my beach behind my home. About 60 cops and rescue workers were searching aviation was up with the spotlight the NYPD harbor unit was searching the ocean, as a former police officer myself I offered to use my night vision to assist on the beach because it was very dark and difficult to see. After about 40 min the search team moved out of my location to search further down the beach I remained. I raised my camera up and I was checking out the stars it was a beautiful night on the water I raised my camera up and noticed two spheres in tight formation separated apart by about 30ft or so they flew over the ocean and onto land extremely fast and silent, I filmed until I could no longer see them there was no light just a dim glow that seemed to pulse slightly through my SIONYX Aurora pro camera. I had an overwhelming feeling inside like it was meant for me to see I felt static in the air as they flew over it was really amazing I yelled so load I was shocked what I seen I have it all on video as well.",
"Three bright spheres moving across sky.  Very loud noise caused me to look out window where I saw three very bright large spheres moving across sky, not as high as jet. One sphere in lead the other two moving in tandem behind.",

I was getting mail and took a picture of the chemtrails...later I noticed objects in the upper right corner...   I did not see anything at the time…,
"I was passing by the Asheville airport in the afternoon, when I noticed a very bright object over the runway.  The sighting occurred on March 3, at approximately 3:00 PM. I don't remember the exact time, since it was 6 months ago. Since I was passing an airport, my first thought was that it was an airliner, with the sun reflecting off it. Then, I realized that it was motionless, hovering just below a cloud, at no more than 3,000 feet, at maybe a 40 degree angle. It was elliptical in shape, as if viewing a saucer from edge on, very bright and glossy silver in color. It was definitely a solid, probably metallic, object. Just as I really focused on it, there was a blinding flash, then it was gone. I can't say if it simply disappeared, or sped off so quickly, that I couldn't track it. I was a passenger in the front seat of a vehicle, on the passenger/airport side of the vehicle, so I had an unobstructed view. The duration of the sighting, no more than ten seconds, did not allow me time to alert the other passengers, until after it had disappeared. It was a sunny day, with a few clouds.  I am a semi-retired radio broadcast engineer, and professional energy manager.",
"Hovering lights for over an hour.  My friend who lives 15 miles west of me texted me and asked if I saw 3 lights in the sky to the west. I went outside on the deck and took 2 videos. My wife and I watched the 2 hover for over an hour and the 3rd would disappear then reappear. What is interesting is that he lives 15 miles west of me and was looking to his western sky. Meaning these lights had to be pretty far away but we’re very visible. After approx 70 mins, the lights (objects) went upward and disappeared. Please email me and I will email you the videos. Having trouble doing it on this site. Thanks",
"Lighted up as passenger jet was flying past it  I had walked outside to lock up my truck when I had the feeling to look up. I was watching a jet flying west to East when suddenly what looked like electricity flickering, moving up and down,from right to left then spiked up around 500ft came down and continued to the left when suddenly a large circle of light came on. The jet was flying even with the bottom of the circle and around the center of it. The bottom of the circle was 4 times the length of the jet. I could see the light through the windows on the jet and the outline of it. The jet was about 50ft from the circle and as it passed the edge of the circle the light went out. My guess is that the jet was around 30,000ft and the circle was 2,000ft across. The sky was clear that night but I saw nothing before or after in the sky.",
"9 yellow orbs float overhead before space x satellites appear.  sitting in my backyard watching the stars, suddenly out of the southwest at about 8ooo ft 9 yellow glowing orbs floated over heading northwest. they had no definitive formation they appeared to go very slowly and disappeared out of site, making no noise,no strobe or blinking lights. the interesting thing was this was just 5 minutes before the space x satellites began to appear.",
At least 100 bright lights in a very long straight line and was very quiet.  These objects were flying quietly in a very long straight line.When I first looked in the sky I thought it was a bunch of stars until I noticed that they were moving in a perfect straight line going in a northeastern direction.I watched for about ten minutes.,
"30 small orb lights in a row  At about 8:50 pm, I looked slightly to the west, almost directly overhead and saw a long string of little round lights in a perfect line moving north/northeast. They were going at least three times the speed of typical airplanes we see flying over us. The flight path of passenger jets is always from west to east  I counted 30 of them, all in a perfectly straight line about 2 degrees apart from each other. That means that the total angle from the first one to the last one was about 60 degrees of angle flying across the sky. There might have been more, but when I spotted them, the first one was getting low on the horizon and was fairly dim.",
"3 yellow/orange fireball like lights traveling silently and following each other.  3 lights observed traveling north to south. The lights were yellow orange, like a flame from a fire.  They appeared to be round with a haze around them so I couldn’t determine a shape. There was no sound and they seemed to be traveling at a steady rate of speed. They were following each other but were not close together. The night was overcast so they appeared to disappear once they got far enough away. The lights did not blink, they were steady, like a burning flame. As the 3rd light passed over, we lost internet connection  for a brief period of time. We believe that UFO’s probably exist, but until now, we’ve never seen anything to cement that belief.",
"10-12 objects flying in formation just above horizon, silently one after the other going north over Sierra  On Wednesday, May 5th at 20:57-59, I looked southward out my bathroom window as sirens had just gone by and I could see a sheriff's helicopter in the far distance south of me, then out of the corner of my right eye, following the large electrical lines going North, were what looked like 10 to 12 Canadian geese flying in sequence one after another with lights on each object, silently flying medium speed but close to the ground or at least on the horizon, just above the high power electrical lines. I ran outside with both my glasses and binocs but didn't need them because there they were, 10-12 similar objects, flying one in front of the other going north, no sound, but lights under each one. They were just flying in sequence, going north towards Fallon, following the same trajectory that jets from Lemoore to Fallon follow. They were soundless, there were other aircraft in the sky close enough to see this spectacle but I see no mention of it on the internet. H! owever, it is similar to one sighting in the April sightings near the east coast of the USA but the difference is they were all staying the same altitude and in formation like Canadian geese with lights under their bodies. Please someone tell me they were drones? Not likely.",
I submitted my report at 11:30 today but it is NOT A UFO SIGHTING; IT WAS JUST THE DAMN SATELLITES!  I'M SO SORRY.,
"Weird string of lights  A perfectly straight string of lights was moving fast across the sky North West Bound The lights looked just like other stars in the sky in terms of size, color and brightness.  The sky was completely clear tonight with lots of visible stars.  There was no sound.",
"30 plus white circular objects in linear flight in Tucson, AZ sky.  On 5/5/2021 my wife and I witnessed flying objects in the sky.  They were white and circular flying in a linear pattern flying at high speeds. 30 or so of them became in view of the naked eye one by one and were all gone in a matter of 5 minutes.  They had to be flying at high speeds to disappear so quickly.  My wife and I have never seen anything like it.  I typically see satellites orbiting the earth, but nothing compares to what we witnessed last night.  I have a background in finance, while my wife is a registered nurse.",
"100+ lights in single formation flying SW over LA county  UFOs sighted May 5, 2021 around 9pm. Lights in a single line flying similar distance from one another. It had been seen by my husband first. I went outside about 1 to 2 minutes after his sighting. I saw the last 10 lights flying south west. My husband said there were about 100 lights flying in the form I saw of the last 10.",
A large group of small star like crafts flying in a straight line heading from north east spaced out evenly about 5 to ten feet apart and made no sound,
Single file streaming like abarmada aprox 200  as we 4 watched amazed calling to the nebors to come see. As a friend pulled up he also awe struck .im to excited to keep writing but the bunch of us will speak to someone from this center if they wish,
"My wife and I were in the hot tub when I observed 8 circular lights heading northeast over the Pine Nut Mountain Range in northwestern Nevada. They were in a straight line, evenly spaced, with no flashing lights like a normal aircraft displays. We observed them for about two minutes, then they just disappeared.",
String of approximately 10 circular lights moving in one direction overhead very slowly disappearing one at a time  Went out into my yard and looked up and noticed that there was a string of what looked like stars moving in single file slowly about the speed you might see and satellite move. They were only visible for about 30 to 40 seconds. The ones leading the procession one by one disappeared until all 10 were gone. No sound was evident.,
Approximately 60 aircraft lined up like a train flying  south to north.  I saw a line of approximately 60 aircraft flying south to north in a very straight line. It was very similar to watching a freight train from a distance.,

"I saw these lights and Bliss Idaho.They were all in a straight line.Possibly a little higher than a small plane would fly.Moving slowly from west to east,And then after they went over my head they dissipated and disappeared.",
40-50 lights in line across the Reno sky.  Witnesses 40-50 lights in a general line headed north to east. Time was about 9:25pm. Close proximity to each other. My location is West Reno at the time of the sighting. Never seen aircraft in that large of a number before. I tried to get video recording but was talking on the phone so the video option was not available. By the time I called my wife to come outside and help me figure out why I was unable to record a video it was gone. Figured I share what I saw in case of others saw it also.,
"Very long, straight craft with string of bright lights on it seen moving slowly in night sky near Williams Arizona.  Sighting details: At approximately 2130hrs on May 5th, 2021, I was taking a walk through a very dimly lit RV park one mile East of Williams Arizona. I happened to look upwards and was immediately startled to notice a nearly perfect straight line of bright white lights stretched horizontally across the sky. As I stopped to look intently upon them I noticed they were slightly brighter white than the stars that were clearly visible in the dark night sky. These lights emitted a constant stream of light and did not have the “twinkling” effect that stars frequently have. The string of lights seemed to be equally spaced from one another, horizontally, but were slightly higher/lower from one another vertically. The lights appeared to all be attached to the same craft, as I could just barely make out a very faint appearance of a gray object against the black sky background. The moment I first saw the light formation it appeared to be stationary, but within a few seco! nds all the lights began to slowly move to my right, in unison with each other. They continued at the same very slow speed until out of sight. I’m not exactly certain of my directional bearings at the time, but I am fairly certain it was moving from the Southwest towards the Northeast in direction. The string of lights was very long. I looked up at about 30 degrees to my left, and it spanned to about 30 degrees to my right. That was my full field of view, due to some tall Ponderosa Pine trees blocking my view of either end of it. I could clearly see approximately 15 lights in a straight line on the object, but there appeared to be more that were being blocked by the trees. It was a very quiet night outside that evening and there was no audible noise coming from this craft.  My background: I am 61 years old. I am retired from the US Air Force. I worked on fighter jets as a maintenance technician. I have a BS degree in Psychology from Grand Canyon University, an Associates Degree in Aerospace Technology, and completed half of the credits needed towards a Masters Degree in Family Counseling from Phoenix Seminary.",
I saw seven flying craft with lights all flying in a line and then disappearing within seconds with no lights,
"3 separate fleets of light in the sky in 1 night.  The first sighting approximately 09:42pm started as my son and myself looked up and saw a slow moving what looked like a fleet of solid bright lights movong from north west to south east that lasted for four minutes and completely stopped. Looked to be not that far apart from each other. The second event that was a matter of minutes after, 09:58pm after was witnessed by my Father,mother, my two sons ages 14 and 18 and my Boyfriend, along with myself moving from west to east. Looked to be coming from a point we couldn't see, moving more quickly than the first and multiplied in a very straight row. What seemed to be atleast 80+ then dissapeared. The third event happen on the complete opposite side of the sky South west direction from us approximately 10:18pm the same night, looked to be very fast moving light that headed straight up into the sky, very clustered together and started separating as they seemed to dissappear.  Bright balls of lights like the other! anomalies and very circular in shape. Clustered together.  The difference to this one was as I said seemed to be moving directly up into the sky.  3 events, completely opposite sides of the sky, and very different formations.",
"I thought I was looking at Cassiopeia with its 'W' shape, then I released that it was a series of lights moving silently across the sky in a straight line, but in a zig zag formation. There was a much brighter light, then two, that appeared to be flying up and down alongside the formation, almost as if they were escorting them. After a couple of minutes they suddenly disappeared, then about five minutes or so later, they suddenly re-appeared back in the spot where I initially saw them, taking the same path I'd watched them take a few minutes earlier. Same bright light, then two, and then they all disappeared exactly the same as the first time. It was as if somebody was replaying it again.",
I was walking down by the lake and saw this long what looked like a contrail left by a jet airplane but all lights it was the weirdest thing I ever saw.,
"Orange/Red circle flying north to south over Toronto  The craft came from the north and was flying south. It was bright orange/red in colour. I thought it was a plane at first but when it flew over my head it was really high, going faster than a plane should and was a circle shape.",
"30+ lights in a line.  I have night vision, watching the sky.  But these were also visible by the naked eye. There were four of us who saw them. Even without the night vision.  Other aircraft we saw had blinking lights. These were solid lights.  Traveling in a line. No blinking as aircraft do. Traveling eastward. Nearly uniform in spacing.  Seemed to appear and travel Eastward.",
"Formation of ten bright lights over Palm Springs  Ten lights were moving in a southeasterly direction in what appeared to be a formation. Lights were spaced evenly apart at approximately one to two degrees separation. Their speed seemed to be constant, they were not accelerating. The lights were bright white, there were no colored lights visible and no sound at all. The lights were not moving in the direction of Palm Springs airport and disappeared to the southeast about 2 minutes after the initial siting. I did not have my camera with me to take pictures.",
A long single file group of approximately 25 to 30 objects moving from the northwest to southeast. The objects appeared like a medium size star. They were spaced about 2 to 3 seconds in movement apart. They moved in a straight line until they disappeared on the horizon.,
I just seen like 20 ufo ...they ufo people will tell u it's something else to cover it up ..believe in what u seen not just that it was some they went other ways ... around the other planets ..that they call stars ...they all went in that one star and that star went in the air higher and higher .... Indianapolis  believe what u seen all or its aye ufo mothership that they went in to then the  mothership went higher and higher until a it disappeared and not only that it's still some flying around that mothership. or the other planet,
"Filmed two spherical metal objects fly by, both following the same flight path.  I was filming the sunset using a drone at approximately 200 feet elevation near Moab, Utah. From the ground I saw what appeared to be a large metal basketball fly past my drone, I turned to watch it fly over the horizon within a few seconds, noting this as the setting sun made the object reflect as if metal as it flew away from me. Upon reviewing my video I noticed I captured two of these objects, the second following a little lower in elevation but at the same speed and trajectory as the first. Both seem to emerge from over rocks on the horizon and fly past the camera. I was filming in 4K resolution at 30fps, so I could slow the footage down to 24fps and before the objects get too close the spherical shape and reflections can be seen. Once they get too close the motion blur gets too intense as they pass by, showcasing the speed.  I have included one of these objects in a detailed video I’ve attached, the second object is not showcased in this attached video but looks similar, just further away. I would be happy to provide the unedited original file.",
Me and a friend were bow hunting early one morning. We were sitting at the truck getting ready to go into these tree belts  when we noticed these lights on the trees and bushes in front of us  they were little round lights.  I went over to a bush to try and see what it was. But had no idea.  We were a little freaked out so we got in the truck and went down the road about 3 miles to another spot I new we could hunt.  We pulled off the road and behind some trees.  While we were sitting there  out of the corner of my eye I see this craft come up to a tee in the road not 50 yards away it was about 12 ft long and 3 ft wide but round.  With a big light on the front.  We were both looking at it  and you could here it ramp up in sound  and it shot down a mile long shelterbelt in just 2 seconds and the bright light on front just went out  we couldn’t see what happened to it.  At this point  I really didn’t want to hunt anymore.  But we decided to give it a try.  We went down this big gully where it was thick with trees. When we got down in the trees.  Our flashlights went out and the Motorola’s stopped working.  All the bugs stopped making noise it was dead silence.  When all the sudden the fields around us lit up bright as football fields at night games.  We jumped into the bushes to hide. I was on high alert  waiting for something to happen  had my bow ready to go.  And 30 seconds later the lights slowly faded out and our flashlights and Motorola’s came back on  scared the hell out of us.  But here is the wired part.  The next thing I know I’m walking around the back of my truck and my friend is already sitting in the passenger seat looking confused  I have no memory of the time in between our flashlights coming on and being at the truck again I don’t remember the quarter mile walk out of there.  It was no fought the weirdest crap that has ever happened to me in my life.   Thanks for listening to my account,
Saw two faceless aliens in the woods.  Was witnessed by my father and his brother  This is a story my father and his brother have told me about the time they belive they saw two alien beings.   My fater and his brother were walking through the woods along the rail road tracks.  They saw two short beings wearing long black over coats and large brimmed hats.  The two beings faced them and My father and his brother saw that they had no face.  It was completly blank and white.  My father and his brother took off running away from the two beings.   Im not sure weather this story is true.  My father assures me it is and I can only take his word for it.   ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged incident is unknown.  PD)),

"germans black program  in ww2 germany was a leader in weapon technology and it was no accident. long before the end of the war, german army was looking for alien technology. in the heart of germany they found something. nobody knows any details, but near the village ""kahla"" they have found something. the area around this village is called Thuringian forest, with high mountains, deep valleys, and a very small population. near ""kahla"" they tunneled a whole mountain called ""walpersberg"". inside they developed a huge facility, and the the most futuristic plane of world war two was build. on top of the mountain was a runway. you could say now, that it was only a plan factory. that`s right, but why there are a lot of ufo sightings and why the german army still uses this area? it is a restricted area.",

And two more appeared 7 in all.a perfect side by side. Not one was higher or farther apart from each other. Not a sound and they came in very smooth like sort of gentle.at this time im frozen in place kinda worried wondering if more willshow up. Then as i looked at them there crafts glowed to dark or! ange to a lighter orange.i saw what looked like a table with someone behind it.then after about 7 minutes msybe 5.they judt left. The first one went west north then they all followed suit. Perfect in ever move.no sound nothin.now comes my contact if you can call it that.my cat about two weeks ago was dying hes loseing hair. So i was thinking on putting him down. Trouble is i cant.i love him.so i got mad and angry cursed the gods and all aliens even the annunaki.big mistake.all my life i new we were not alone but some of it like gods and angles i took as myth.not anymore. I was lying down with my cat half asleep but still alert and awake.i never head him or her but i opened my eyes and was looking into the most beautiful thing i ever saw.it was an eye.

"I've reported this 3 times ,but it's never posted,there's so many UFOs around John Amos n so many witnesses I don't know how the news says nuthin,my friend is high ranking officer in the air Force n also has seen them many times and once within 50 feet ,it's not from here he says unless our government is testing UFOs but why would our military spend loads of time n money chasing the UFOs around John Amos power plant if there our own?",
"Spinning craft ( counter clockwise) I have video  I have a short video of object. It was flying ( still at first) what looked to us to be over the Woodfords County in Nevada.  The sun was shining on the object that was in the sky, it was definitely spinning and made of a metal (because of the shine from sun).  It stood still for about 15 seconds then swayed back and forth while spinning.  I then lost the craft while videoing.   It’s spin was definitely counter clockwise.  It then disappeared from my site.",

"I know it's strange to report a craft in the vicinity of a place where a fictional craft was ""unearthed"" in the popular TV sh  I know it's strange to report a craft in the vicinity of a place where a fictional craft was ""unearthed"" in the popular TV show The:""X-files"" but it happened!  We observed first a ball of light approximately the size of a basketball held at arms length, it was 50 yards away from where my family was enjoying a meal prepared outdoors.  At first everything was calm,then our dogs began to bark in the direction behind the house.  My stepfather was telling them to be quiet.  I was wondering what they saw to disturbed them, as there were many deer on the apple orchard where we lived.  I believe I was first to see a single orb of light, as I had described, it came from the same direction as our dogs had been barking,  very illuminated, & close.  As we watched in awe another ball of light the same size came from behind the 1st.  Then a very intense beam of light, like a search light came from between the first two,& began sweeping up & down the isles between the rows of apple trees, as if searching for something. All of a sudden it seemed to notice US! And shown said beam on to all standing there agape. This is where a time slip accord. I remember seeing us all caught in the light that lit our backyard up stronger than daylight. All we could do was stand rooted in place for I don't know how long, but the ""search-light"" seemed to such up into the place where it originally came from, the 2nd ball of light did the same thing in reverse (that is too say: it went behind the 1st again) and it flew away at an incredible speed! Then all was if it was to start with. All my mother, sister & myself could do was talk about what we had just experienced. My stepfather and brother-in-law wanted too do was get themselves & the kids indoors as fast as possible. The rest of us stood there in disbelief, & shortly decided to investigate the area in which the silent thing had come from. I can remember my stepfather calling us crazy &! to get inside. He said:""it was just a plane"" but my! mother, sister, & myself knew better.  ""If it was only a plane, what are you so frightened of?"" Said I. Just get in here you three nut-jobs he relied! I think about it often, but afraid of ridicule I've never reported it until now. I figure that if anyone can believe it must be you folks. It wasn't till much later that the X-files episode aired, & by that time I was an adult living back in Ohio. Very interesting that of all places for a UFO to be buried on the show being Warfordsburg! It's just a very small hamlet of a town, just a blip of a place to pass on the interstate. That is my story & every bit the truth! Thanks,and: Kind Regards...",

"Please don't put starlink satellites or Saturn to explain away most everything. Read the description first, don't be so dism issive.

The point he makes is a good one, and it explains why we usually put a question make after satellite.  If an object is below cloud level, it almost certainly is not a satellite.  We agree.  PD))",
I a long chain of lights traveling across the sky all perfectly spaced out (30-50 of them). Headed north  A long strand of multiple aircrafts/lights flying in a straight line.  At first there were maybe 30 and traveling faster then any airplane I’ve seen.  Then came more.  They were perfectly spaced out in a line.  And traveled across the sky heading north.  There was no sound.,

"intermittent blinking (.5 of a second) objects which move horizontally across the sky at a moderate/swift rate.  I am a practicing attorney in good standing in all jurisdictions where I am licensed. I am, admittedly, interested in the UAP phenomenon. Because of this, I recently purchased a gen 3 night-vision/thermal monocular w video recording capability. I live in the DC/metro area. I am familiar with the appearance of airplanes and helicopters in the sky. Despite light pollution, the monocular does permit me to get a decent view of stars, planets, and the moon. Given atmospheric effects, I am aware that stars can appear to twinkle, and even bounce, around in the sky at times. Again, I understand this perceived movement of stars is not actually occurring.   Since I have owned this night-vision device, I have recorded some interesting sights/sightings of objects in the late night/early morning sky that are not otherwise visible to the naked eye (please note that I am also not able to see any stars, satellites, or most planets without the night vision). Times of occurrences are btw 11pm-3am numerous weekday evenings. Usually, I witness intermittently (.5 of a second or faster apart/btw blinks) blinking objects which move horizontally across the sky at a moderate/swift (not particularly fast) pace. Sometimes they seem to completely disappear (and not reappear, like a star might). Other times, there have been two closely flying pairs of these lights similarly moving horizontally across they visible section of sky somewhat in tandem. There is no real rhyme or reason to when these lights will appear and/or disappear unlike the flow of airplane traffic to/from Dulles or BWI or National Airports. The objects do not have the blinking lights (green and red with white) that are characteristic of FAA type or military aircraft. I can't make out anything other than a blinking light - is the entire object the blinking light? Or is my camera not detecting the body of the craft? I don't know the answer. The distance appears to be a few miles out from my window at least (can't be sure). There is no discernable sound, but, again, I live in a noisey/congested area. I don’t get the impression that these are satellites. My understanding is that most? all? satellites do not blink or emit their own light source. I have tried to do some digging as to the movement of 'cell phone' reception satellites but I have not found much info. Maybe I am witnessing drones, but they do not appear to fly as I might imagine drones to fly. Also, the DC/metro airspace I live under is extremely restricted, so, at the least, they are not private individuals’ drones. In conclusion, I do save my recordings and am more than happy to meet and share these with whomever is interested. Thanks very much.",

I was abducted several times all through my child hood into adulthood.  I have been in contact in the past with several different types of beings.  I can remember bits and pieces of several abductions at my fathers home and even in a different state after moving from Michigan to Ohio 13 years ago.  I’m currently 39 years old and most of the memory’s I have are from the ages of 5-19 years of age.  I still see crafts every once in a while and have shared sightings with my daughter in fear that she will be abducted and to try and educate her about it.  I have seen 3 crafts saucer shape and  lighting up the entire yard and area brighter than day light.  I have seen even several white/gray looking beings with smaller ones like children.  I have seen big like beings that made you feel more love than parents could ever give you.  I’ve seen beings that look like humans but are so small the craft would fit in the house and they would shrink me to fit in it with them.  I have been in large crafts with all different kinds of beings and seen outer space.  There’s so many bits and pieces of memory’s I just want help to understand why it occurred.  I know it sounds crazy and don’t expect for everyone to believe me but lots of things happened to me and it still affects me at night every night.,

Shiny UFO spotted  I saw the craft and immediately noticed something was strange. There we other planes in the sky all of which left a exhaust plume. The ufo was still at first. Very shiny. It was close enough that I could see the sun reflecting off the hull. At this point I pulled over. I was debating on grabbing my phone but decided to keep my eyes on the craft. The craft started to slowly move within a minute it literally disappeared. Again no clouds in the sky. Just like someone hit a switch. Poof gone. All other planes were still visible at this time.  I'm glad I decided to keep my eye on it. Because I witnessed the craft dissappear while I was looking. Ufo was at the height a small plane would fly. About 100 feet long. Very very shiny. When it started moving the sun hit it was very reflective.,

"tictac/dreidel  Driving with my friend, and other witness, Ivan, we saw something that looked like a tictac in the sky. The object was very high up and didn't move like a drone or anything we knew. The object, after a while, turned, its shape changed and looked more like a dreidel I could see like, a distortion around the object and then it left in a line of light a la star trek.

"I realized over a year or so ago that all that was happening was coming from the sky.  After being stalked and encountering with this type entity I realized the whole time it has been coming from the sky. I would first see a craft shaped like a boomerang way up in the sky and sometimes a bit lower in the sky. There is this large craft with many lights, rather large and then there are smaller ones with a distinctive shape and these crafts follow me everywhere I go, its like they know when I am going to leave my home because it would be waiting outside my home for me to come out. There were or sometimes would be many of these small aircrafts which tends to look like stars but is a bit different than a star. This here information is going to sound rather or a bit crazy but there are some type of shadow or light flickering people,, things or whatever they are that I see. They tend to follow me where ever I go and I believe they hear everything I say. I have encountered many problems from this entity, its like they are invisible but their shape is kind of seen even tho they are invisible. They roam through my house and would be in my car somehow. I have no clue what I am reporting about, all I know is there is always these aircrafts following me and it seems like they beam something down on my vehicle from the sky and there would be one to five shadows of them in my car. I know this sounds a bit far fetched but this shit is really happening around me. I have seen different type faces and in the beginning I saw a rather large being that had the face and eyes of an alien but I wasnt sure what I was seeing; all I know is, I am tired of being subjected by them they involve themselves in my everyday life and every time I leave my house they follow me. The whole thing puzzles me because there is also a helicopter involved somehow cause whenever I get to where I am going the helicopter show up and fly over my car during the day but at night is when the boomerang type aircrafts come out and follow me along with this kind of big craft with many lights follow me along with some other strange type crafts that are very bright lighted with an odd shape. I know this all sounds confusing, mind you it all is confusing for me and unbelievable! but this goes on in my everyday life from the minute I wake up to the time I fall asleep, which is very annoying and stressful. I'm not sure if Columbus, Ohio official have any inkling of what fly around in their skies at night, starting the minute dark hits and it is many of them. You never see them during the day but they always come out at night. I'm not joking or just making something up, this shit is really happening and I don't know what to do because it is targeting me on a constant basis and they never let up and never give me a break. This thing here that has been happening needs to be investigated although I believe they have many techniques to cover themselves to not get caught or even for someone to see them because they hear everything, see everything and know how to make themselves unknown. There is more to this report that I have to say but so far I don't think anyone would believe this, of what I'm reporting. Hell! I don't believe it, but its definitely been happening and at one point in the beginning of this turmoil I thought I was going to lose my mind because they hunted me daily. There are many things I can tell in this report but much of it is unbelievable, I say this to myself all the time. I want my privacy back and want this invasion to go away. I don't know who or what could help me but I am tired of it. I came to believe it is aliens when I first realized all the shadowy stuff and faces were coming from the sky. The things I have seen and encountered with this entity has not been nice,, not at all. I do not know who to turn to about this or in fact if anyone could stop this from happening because around me. The main thing is the following and harboring over where I live in the sky, beaming something or someone into my home where my daughter, husband and I live. It took me awhile to decide to do this report because I never thought anyone would believe me. I live in the Redwood Apartments in Pickerington Ohio off Refugee rd. To sum this all up, I do not know if these are aliens I am encountering or what but I'm needing to be free of it all. Columbus, Ohio need to check out their skies at night and find out what are these objects flying around their skies. I need to find out why they are hovering around me 24/7. The main thing is who or what are they, where they come from etc.... and why are they after me all the time. This maybe something no one could ever solve or find out what they are and where they come from. There is more to this report but I am tired and know that they are right here watching me write this report to you all and I dont know, it may not even get to you because they are also hacked into my phones, computers and tv's, its like a nightmare.",

I was standing on my lawn when I heard a military Jet screaming by afterburners on I looked up saw the jet then saw perfect circle  I was outside speaking with a neighbor when our attention was immediately drawn to the sky because we heard the sound of a military jet screaming just overhead the jet had to have been using his afterburner it was so loud we both looked up but did not see jet due to trees in our yard covering the sky I moved to my tree lawn and had a perfect view of the sky which was clear and temperatures were reaching 60 F. I now could see the Jet clearly coming from the North heading Southwest then I Noticed another higher in the sky coming from the Southwest as the two converge I clearly saw a perfect circle it was crystal clear as the jets approached each other the Circle just immediately disappeared extremely quickly. The circle appeared as the jets approached then it was gone. I said to my neighbor did you see that ? He did not due to where he was standing and did not have a clear view but I did it was extremely incredible. No question on what I viewed. The circle was perfect in dimensions the color was like a high grade silver with a polyurethane high gloss finish.,

"3 fireballs moving slow from West to East  At around 01:02 I was traveling through Amesbury heading north. It an area I have been through multiple times during the day. At the intersection of Rt 150 and S Hampton Rd I noticed a light to the approximate 5° of north. Maybe along the direction of Rt 150, I had already turned onto S Hampton Rd.  I have worked in the cellphone tower constitution industry, and my first thought was a tower light. That is until I noticed the color, and lack of blinking. I have also spent six years in the military. What it reminds me of is a military handheld illumination flare. That is a flare lacking illumination radius, smoke, or noise. A solid yellow fireball.  At the time it looked stationary  It wasn't till I was up S Hampton Rd approximately a quarter mile that I saw the other two objects. They were approaching me from the west across the field at Amesbury Elementary School. They looked to be separated by a couple hundred meters. Because of their shape and size, about the size of a basket ball. An there was absolutely no sound. I could judge distance or altitude.  At this point I stop. After referencing Google maps. I believe I stopped at 22 S Hampton Rd. The objects passed just south of me, moving east. The first object started to fade. Fade as in moving in a straight line away from me. Not over the horizon. The second object seemed to stay the same.  I left the area shortly after. If I can upload the short video i took. It does not do what I saw justice.  I'm my time in the military I have seen all types of flares and aircraft. I would even say these were aircraft. But there was absolutely navigation lights. Nothing was blinking.",
It happened on my way back from my girlfriends house.  I was coming back from my girlfriends house and I remembered just passing the jet blue baseball stadium that the red socks have their spring training at. I was looking up at the sky when an incredibly bright light blazed through the sky incredibly fast. I thought it was an airplane at first but was going way too fast to be an airplane and I would say it was a meteorite but there was no tail and the light was too big and incredibly bright.,
"A very distant, bright, seemingly intelligent, seemingly nonthreatening ""dancing"" almost light.  On a clear, Saturday night on March 5th, 2022 at 8:20, I was stopped at a stop sign at the end of Liberty St. In Sharon, Pa. I was about to turn right onto the freeway.

It seemed to knowing float right up past my view from the drivers side of my sedan. So, I took my phone out and tilted it up, out of my car window and took a picture. I was able to take a few more pictures as, this bright light was seeming to stay for about a half an hour, changing shapes and directions and seemed to be kind of putting on a show or ""dancing"".

"3 orbs in a straight line perfectly spaced apart, all flying in unison as if it were one  Went to visit my parents in Michigan. We had a little campfire and invited some friends. We were looking for satellites and after so long we gave up and everyone was staring at the fire and chatting. Someone in our group said hey look at that so we all looked up and seen three orbs, bigger than stars, looked hazy or like some fog was over them. They had a slight greenish hue. They were in a straight line and equally spaced apart all floating in unison as if it were one. We watched it fly by at a slow to medium pace and the orb in the front as well as the orb in the back started drifting farther from the middle one, and then it was just gone. Like it just vanished. I still cannot believe we all seen that. I put it on Facebook and two family members, one from temperance Michigan and the other from Ohio said they witnessed it as well. So in total 10 of us seen this. Another thing to add is that it was very quiet and peaceful out, the craft made no noise whatsoever and there were no airplanes or helicopters in the sky at that point.",
"I saw a glowing, spinning ""star"" above the lake near Mt. St.Helens.  Around 9:30 pm I saw a bright object in the sky that appeared to be brighter than the other stars in the sky. I went into the house to grab my cell phone to take pictures and videos. I was able to capture both pictures and videos. The still images appear both square and circular, like an aura was around the square in the center. The videos captured showed that it was spinning and moving around in the night sky, making odd movements. At times it looked like the aura would spin around spitting out little dots of white, and then it would all come back tightly to the glow. It was white/orange/and sometimes almost green. This light got brighter and brighter to my naked eye, so much so that I got the sensation it was moving closer to me. I briefly got nervous and I went inside for an hour or so, and returned to see if it was still there. I did see it each time I went back outside. My pictures and videos were all captured from 9:30 to 2 or 3 in the morning.",
Not sure what to put in this bit.  I was going to bed and having a cigarette out side then I seen one light that changed into two that change into three not sure if it was one ufo or three as the three lights were rotating round each other then a fourth light appeared not far from the other three lights then they disappeared on the photos and videos I have taken you can see loads of Energy/ Static on the video i have you can see the lights moving rapidly and in strange patterns while this was going on my dogs were barking mad I felt like I had frozen in time and felt emotional a very strange experience and this happened in the same place in February 2023,

"1 OR 2 SMALL SPHERES  I was dropping off cardboard at a recycling bin & I noticed a set of glowing reddish to white flashing lights. The sky was clear over Lake Erie & the lights caught my attention. I have lived in the area over 5 years and have used this location for over 2 years. I never saw these lights before. I then drove over to the park and watched these lights for about 3 minutes before the lights disappeared. I stayed there for about 2 minutes waiting for them to reappear, they did not. I went home, less than a 1/2 mile away. Approximately 30 minutes later I heard the unmistakable sound of a USCG Helicopter.",
"While driving my 16 yr old daughter to work, we saw what looked like seagulls floating in the air. Not flying.... gliding.  The objects were white and then completely disappeared and would appear again in the same spot. After watching this happen for about 15 minutes another 10 objects appeared below them. Crystal clear day, blue skies. White objects flying so close together and could literally disappear without blinking. No sounds... nothing.",
"Saw what sort of looked like Starlink satellites, but they were traveling due west.  Late afternoon, saw other people at the park looking up, looked up to see what appeared to be reflection off of planes directly overhead, except that they were so high there was no visible form, just the flashes of reflection off the sun (which was behind us in relation to the objects), there were no contrails, and there were a bunch of them traveling in a row (but not a perfect line). The thing that made it really weird was that they were traveling due west, which to my knowledge is not something satellites do. There were commercial aircraft in the air as well with contrails and visible wings. Whatever we saw was WAY higher and traveling faster.",
MADAR Node 87,
I took 5 minute video of it  It floated across sky rotating with light or sun glare.,
I saw a glimmer in the sky and looked up to see a white object stationary  I noticed that at that altitude..it remained stationary as the stratospheric clouds seemed to zoom by the object.,
Possible Craft which shot something out or was almost hit by something  Was on my back deck with new phone taking video when craft appeared. It moved southwest and also appeared to shoot something out of it or almost get hit by something.,
"I saw a low small white very bright light moving across a clear sky for a few seconds it then appeared to flash and totally disappear  I live in Stockwood, South Bristol. I happened to look out of my bedroom window and I live on a hill so I have a clear view above any houses or trees. A very bright white light was quite low and moving across a clear sky some distance away. The sky was reasonably light. I couldn’t see any shapes or edges. It was like a large star. There was only 1light and no other colours in the light. It appeared to be going in a straight line. It slowly travelled across the sky for a few seconds, then appeared to flash and totally disappeared.",
"At 7:00 PM on 3/6/2022 I was driving east on East Main Street, when I observed 3 reddish-orange lights in an isosceles triangle out my driver-side window. They were in the northeastern quadrant of the sky about 45 degrees from the horizon. My first thought was, ""I didn't know there was a radio tower there."" When I realized the actual altitude of the lights, I pulled over and stopped by Lyons Construction Services, to get a better view. The point of the triangle was pointing ""up."" I observed the lights for about a minute and then they simply weren't there anymore. I didn't see anything physical connecting the lights. They never moved at all. I know they weren't flares because I've see lot's of flares and they didn't fit a description of flares. They were not aircraft, either. There was no sound. Once they disappeared, I proceeded to my destination.",
I have been filming and witnessing bizarre UAP for 2 years. This fleet was recorded flying overhead after spotting numerous orbs.  This formation was spotted flying after seeing multiple orbs and other pairs of fast moving UAP. This is part of more footage.,
"Hovering object, possibly disc-shaped, with many red, yellow, blue and green lights that were in constant motion  It was a very clear night (for a change), and I headed to bed at 12:45 a.m. Monday night/Tuesday morning. I saw a bright light that appeared to have multiple colors on it hovering above and just to the right of the red light from a tower on the top of the mountain directly across the river. I believe that is an internet ""line of sight"" tower. I could tell it wasn't a star because it moved strangely. It wasn't a plane because it just hovered, but not super steadily. I could see from using the tower light and the frames on my large windows as reference points that it wasn't super steady. It would move slightly in various directions, but still hover. I have some new (good) binoculars that I retrieved from my living room. I could see the object from there also. I took the binoculars back to bed, and observed it for at least 15 minutes straight. It was wider than it was tall, and the image was a bit shaky with binoculars, so I couldn't make out the shape details clearly. But there were multiple fast-moving lights that appeared to stay in constant motion. Red, yellow, green and blue lights. It wasn't stealthy at all. The lights stayed in constant motion or flashing on and off the entire time I observed it. I wanted to see it fly away and see how it moved, but I got tired. Turned over to try to sleep, probably 10 minutes later, I looked again and it was gone. I looked all over the sky to see if I could see it. Nothing. I wish I'd gone outside to see if I could hear anything, but I didn't. I didn't take pictures because I didn't think it would be clear enough. I am 100% certain it wasn't a plane or a star.",
"Object followed me matching my speed  Object started following me as I entered I-75 South, heading from LaFollette, TN to Powell, TN, matching whatever speed I did. Originally white in color, round and following from about a mile away. When I got to the Powell exit, it came with 200 feet. I pulled over on exit, rolled down window and took shown picture. Did not see after turning onto main road in Powell.",
"X or Plus Sign shape moveing slow and silent upward angle  I left my house between 6:07 to 6:08 AM. I turned North onto Sands Road and noticed what I initially thought was an airplane. They are extremely common as we are close to XNA airport. However, this was a very odd and large X or + (plus sign) shape. It was moving slow, just below cloud level at a slight upward angle heading North - Northwest. I watched the craft enter into the cloud layer and disappear inside. I heard no sounds of jet or prop-driven aircraft. I turned West onto Wallis Road trying to continue to view its path and turned left (South) back into the housing development main entrance. There were no vehicles present in any direction. I continued around and stopped to try to recover my view but it was gone. I was awestruck and didn't have the presence of mind or time (since it disappeared so quickly) to get out my phone for a video or photo capture.  I am an aircraft enthusiast, and this was not an aircraft.  The Crafts' top 2 outstretched ""arms"" (for lack of a better description) of the craft had (1) light at the end (white). The very center of the ""X"" or + (plus sign) had a RED LIGHT. The 2 Lower arms had 2 lights each (on each arm). I have made a couple of Drawings (included here) of the shape to define as best as possible, what it appeared like.  It was much too large to be a drone. (This craft would have been between 50 to 100 feet in dimension. )  It was not LifeFlight, helicopter, Osprey or other military craft. The craft was silent. Nothing was audible.  (I wanted to try to debunk what I saw, so I downloaded and checked Flightpath 24 software to my phone. There were 3 flights between 6 AM and about 6:15 am. None of the flight paths were over my home that morning. The closest path was several miles south. I completed a screen recording of the flight paths to try to disprove what I had just seen, but it just reinforced the reality of it. )  Background: I am a Senior Director of Business Development in consumer goods, in my 50's.

"Witnessed a shimmery/metallic object move at a high rate of speed from right to left, left to right, and then sit stationary  The object was very abnormal. I’ve seen plenty of planes, helicopters, weather balloons, and I enjoy watching the night sky. This was nothing of the sort. The object had a chrome shiny exterior, and reflected light as if it were a mirror. It moved much faster than the planes I’ve seen, and seemed to change direction in an instant. The object stopped and remained stationary, so I grabbed my phone and began recording. I was in a work van that was pretty dirty so getting good footage was hard. I noticed the object began shimmering, before moving southwest and disappearing. My boss was the driver of the vehicle. He is a church minister, and a devoted Christian. He was the only other witness in the vehicle with me. He had trouble seeing it while driving. When I reviewed the video I took, (IPhone 13 Pro Max) I noticed a strange interference on the video that created blurry pixels on the objects near me in the video. The video is poor, but my eyesight is not.",
Bright silver object  See video,
We step outside and looked up. It was like a spiral galaxy with a center bright point  We looked up and saw the light in the sky it was huge. It was bright in the center and it remained stationary in the sky and it never changed its shape and it was surrounded by spiral clouds but it looked like a spiral galaxy and we watched it move in the sky from north to south along the sky and it completely remain the same shape and there was a light above it in the top left and then moved at a consistent speed with it it was very low to the ground and appeared to be right above the trees when I called and reported I was informed that a man from Harrison Arkansas had called minutes before me to report the same thing and he captured 24 images of the object in the sky that me as three other people witnessed in Mount Pleasant Texas from miles away.,
Flat shaped object.  Unsure if it was just a play on lighting. This was in daylight and the object appeared to be extremely large and black. Other aircraft were in the distance. I recorded the sighting on my iPhone while driving home.,
Driving with wife when craft emitting neon green purple and orange lights flew from North to south over I 80 some fields and w towards  Almost as if Aurora lights emitted from or and behind or was using the Lights to power the craft. I've seen some crazy things that were unexplainable in my life. But this was truly bizarre and still has my wife and I shook up.,
"1 light turned into 2 flew almost directly over our home.  While in bed I noticed a strange light just above the other homes rooftops in the neighborhood. It then split into 2 separate lights (amber in color). My wife and I were facing south as we watched, and they were headed north. The first ball maintained a constant direction and speed, while the other flight seemed more sporadic before matching the speed of the first. We opened the window thinking they were helicopters but no sound was emited. We watched them until they were over our roof. Next we ran downstairs to the front of the house to continue watching. We located the light immediately, still heading from south to north. The second light faded out as the original one continued on its path. Then a smaller light shot straight down and stopped just below the first light making a streak that faded quickly. In a clockwise motion the small ball rotated 90° to the same level as the original and then shot back into the original ball. It continued to move north never changing in elevation or speed as it disappeared through the clouds. Camera footage was terrible when facing north due to bright house lights and streetlights. I am former military and have seen and been in military aircraft in combat and training, this is like nothing I've seen.",

"Awakened by a bright light outside window  Sharing this for a dear friend, On the morning of 2/2/22 at around 5:45 AM She was woken from sleep by a light bright enough to make her think some one turned on the light in the room. There was an object in the sky she immediately grabbed the phone and went outside to take photos, she also retrieved a camera and took a few more. The object was stationary and oriented to the east of her location. She observed for 10-15 minutes then went inside for a brief moment when she returned it was gone. Location is Valrico FL, in the Tampa area. there is an AFB base to the north the ocean to the west. She has witnessed Drones also and ""dark"" helicopters in her area before. appreciate any thoughts on this First four with cellphone, The others Nikon P1000.

Thank you for you consideration in this matter",
"80 to 100 balls of light.  I was heading west on I 80 passing the exit for Bloomsburg. It was overcast and misty. During the sunrise the clouds had a bluish pink hue. Above the highway stretching across the valley, about 80 to 100 glowing yellow/orange balls lit up, and disappeared. I coukd tell they were in the clouds as the glowing orbs cast a glow around them through the clouds. No paticular formation. Random pattern. All lit up at once.",
"2 adult individuals witness a distant object extremely high in the southern night sky over walsenburg Colorado.  The object was illuminated but it was assumed that was the setting sun's rays were striking the object. The object was at times stationary but at  times it's path of travel was also moving in all directions. As an example the object would move forward, backward,and in a curved path it. It's speed was variable and it's excelleration was uneven sometimes quite fast then stationery and it's path also would wobble at times. As a pilot of various aircraft I know of no such capability for the movements observed by any man made craft including drones at the altitude observed. Being that the object was at a extremely high altitude no discernable shape was observed. The objects movements were it's only distinguishing  characteristics from the other observed objects being stars, planets and satellites. The night sky was perfectly clear and No obscurations w! ere present. A number of satellites moved in the object's area but their tracks were straight and constant in contrast to the object observed. The object appeared as a star.",

"Was looking north observing an airplane coming from east to west at approx 25,000-30,000ft, 75° above elevation, surrounded by objects  They initially appeared to be a flock of geese much higher than the airplane, spread out in a horizontal, semi straight line. Within 2-3 seconds, enough time to get my binoculars, there were 5 or 6 round, oval object directly over and under the airplane. As they swarmed around the plane and it's contrail, they went from being dark and colorless, undefined in shape, to bright white, round and oval shaped.

"Lights very high in the sky moving aircraft speed moving from SW to NE direction. Evenly spaced in a straight line, appeared to be same height as a star but definitely much higher than aircraft. The lights seem to be diffused. There were about a dozen first pass, then slowly one by one faded out in the sky. About 10 minutes later they appeared again near the same star as first sighting, only there were many more this time. Still seeming to be in formation but with a couple of them spaced closer together. There were 30 or more this time which led me to believe maybe they were flying in a large circle. It was hard to decide if it was a large circle or if there were that many more flying in a straight line. No other aircraft visible in the sky at this time however aircraft sighted several minutes after disappearance of sited crafts. The lights did not vary in brightness but they were not as bright as aircraft or stars. I was looking NW when i first spotted them.",

"String of dozens of solid lights  High altitude string of non-blinking yellow lights viewed in eastern sky traveling north. Most were evenly spaced apart. Looked like a very long string of military formation planes but way too fast, lasting way too long, no blinking lights and so many it would have to be some sort of massive movement larger than I’ve ever seen outside of the history channel for a world war. Giant tracer rounds would make sense if they were not so precisely traveling straight across the same path at the same speed across the entire skyline without changing color speed or drifting.

"Dozens of aircraft, seen traveling in a line, outside Madison Wisconsin.  Looked like oriens belt, but with 40 stars instead of 3.  Me and my wife were traveling down Fitchrona Rd, just outside Fitchburg Wisconsin, when I looked out the car window and saw what appeared to be 20-30 stars lined up like oriens belt.  It immediately struck me because they were all lined up together, and from the side window I was looking out of, it almost looked like a halo of stars around the earth.  At the time, I couldn’t tell if they were moving, so I told my wife to pull over so I could get a better look, because I wanted to see if they were stationary.  When I got out I could see that they were traveling from the west to the east.  We were traveling north to south.  I did shoot a video but is is rather difficult to make out without a big screen.  When I watched the video some of the craft were a little out of line with one another, and I was looking for identifiers as I used to work on planes in the navy, but they were just bright glowing lights.  I also have never seen such a large number of aircraft ! flying together like that.  It reminded me of when you see all the military vehicles on the interstate driving together.  Just one big line going to the same place.",

String of objects silently moving through the night sky  Took the dog out to pee. Looked up to the west at the stars and saw a stream of lights single file traveling at a slow rate of speed moving from south headed north. There was no sound.  They would appear from the south travel north and disappear.  I ran inside to get my phone and came back out to take a video but couldn’t see any on my screen.  So I ran back inside and got my camera and though I couldn’t see them on my screen I was able to get one picture of one of them.  After they had all flown by I called my wife to tell her what I saw.  I came inside for a few minutes and went back outside for another look.  I saw them all at once at a high altitude in a single file making like a single line.  Then they faded out.,

There was no doubt in my mind what I was seeing, I knew. A fleet of UFO's. There was no sound, and they moved in precise order. And they just kept coming. Once they got farther North East, they just simply disappeared. I guessed maybe 50, but I don't know how many I missed before I got outside. Tried to video it but I was shaking so bad, I hit video on phone and forgot to hit play. Dang it. Probably a once in a lifetime event. Quite scarry, to see so many.",

We began to see a series of lights passing over in the clouds across the water a good distance from where we were tied down.   I started filming so I could zoom in to see what they were. Suddenly the clouds parted a bit and we could see it was not a series of lighted separate objects, but rather a series of lights around a huge disk-shaped object that was hovering in place. It had one light on the top and a series of lights rotating around the outermost edge. The scale of the object was enormous, particularly given that it was above the furthest edge of the lake from us, all the way across the Chestatee Bay.   I got a text that disrupted my filming, and I looked down at my phone to start it again, but the clouds closed up again and it then disappeared.",

"7-10 orbs that first looked like stars moving in a line, south towards Lake Ontario.  Hello, I was out walking my dog the other week around 11:00 pm and saw something curious. I saw three stars in the sky and thought it was Orion's belt, but then noticed that were slowly moving southbound towards Lake Ontario.   The three orbs (they just looked like stars, they were very distant) moved along at a constant pace, southbound. Then I noticed another orb appear on the north end of the line, also moving southbound. More orbs started appearing in this fashion in a straight line, steadily moving southbound. When the line was about 5 orbs long, the southmost one would disappear. Approximately 7-10 orbs appeared and travelled along this route until they faded from the sky one by one reaching the ""end"" of the line .   Nothing crazy, just thought it seemed curious and I didn't know what they could be.",
Look at the clear north Sky. Looking at big dipper. I saw 6 orbs bright light. Much larger the the stars. Moving much faster then a satellite. They appeared one at a time in a stagerd straight line. Then disappeared one at a time. I had a hard time sleeping the rest of the night.,

Looked upward toward the zenith near the north. Movement of ""stars"" caught my eye. Then I saw more moving points of light. First thought was a satellite array moving together; then it became evident that there were scores of objects (maybe 20-30) following in a straight line moving from SSW to NNE through tail of Ursa Major. I would estimate the brightness of the points of light to be -2 magnitude. All followed the same path. Spacing was not uniform. No noise. They flickered out before reaching the horizon (possibly passing through the earths shadow terminator.   Might have been multiple deployments of satellites.",

From my observation it seem as the ufo was As I slowed down to pull my camera out I noticed it was vertical tilted at and angle to where all the lights where pointed towards me, I was unable to make out the details of the what it looked like exaclty I started record it for about 30 seconds before I had to keep driving due to a car coming up from behind. Due to my research there is no dount is was a ufo, in the video I recorded you can see that it was just hovering there if it were an airplane I would have only had a couple of seconds before it would have descended to land & from the video evidence I have you can see that it didn’t descend but since it was so dark you can only see the lights in the video.!

A string of lights going from south to north.  About 10-15 degrees from zenith west. The lights followed a straight line but were somewhat staggered. The lights appeared from about 10-15 degrees south from zenith and traveled due north 10-15 degrees.  They appeared from nothing visible in the sky and disappeared behind a small cloud.  Me my wife and son all saw them. My son was the first to see them and called to my wife and me to look as well. He tried to count but lost count to tell us.

"While walking my dog in the early evening on 5/7/21 in Antioch, California around 9:15 p.m., I saw lights about the size of stars moving across the sky.  They appeared to be moving in pairs of two.  They weren't blinking and seemed to appear out of one part of the sky and then disappear in another part.  They faded in one part of the sky and faded out in another.  They were moving from West to East.  In all there were probably 15-20 pairs before the phenomena ended.",
"String of lights over Raleigh near falls lake  Near Falls Lake walked out of the house. Wife looked up and said ""what's that"". I said probably birds. She then said ""birds that have lights?"" Conditions sparse clouds, dark. Second look I could see a string of lights heading west to east in an subtle arc. Moving at a pace probably double to triple a commercial airliner. Evenly spaced if I held a ruler to the sky I would say 1/2 inch apart from my vantage point. Some were a little higher than others all moving steady in the same direction. When they hit a certain spot in the sky they disappeared one by one as if going behind a curtain. They came into view in the west about 25% (1/4 distance from horizon) across the night sky disappearing at about the same point in the east. My 18 year old son also saw this. We tried to film it but it came out too dark to see. The lights were very very high in the sky",
"A consistently appearing flying lighted unidentifiable object appearing on our farm’s night IR trail camera.  We have captured a number of flying lighted anomalies on our farm night IR trail cam. Multitude dates, always night.  Not any kind of crafts.  Not camera ‘anomalies’.  There seems to be consistency in shape, though unusual in both movement and structure.  As the camera is set to shoot stills upon movement, they are triggered only by wildlife and have been catching these flying lighted objects accidentally.  Animals in photos do not appear to see them.  They are not seasonal. We have photos of birds, moths, bats, eagles, & various bugs on a number of the cameras photos therefore can rule these all out as plausible explanations.  They appear both close and further away from the lenses and clarity is affected like any other object would be.  We have many photos at least 35.  After much searching, we are at an utter loss as to identifying the origin and have decided to make an official report due to the consistency of appearances and lack of plausible explanation. Hence! fitting the description of an ‘unidentifiable flying object’.",
"Series of lights 50+ viewed on same trajectory,  A constant line of star like forms, moving on a single trajectory slowly along Marin headlands west to east at first in front of us.

The lights were spaced at different intervals, some seemed to be catching up and varying ever so slightly in speed, some were flying closer together, some more spaced out.",
"Large Amber orb with pulsating light.  I was driving home from the corner store and as I turn eastbound onto my street, my eyes caught a very large glowing Amber colored orb very high in the sky hello it was a pulsating bright light.

However, it stopped suddenly and hovered for approximately 20 minutes.  When zooming in on the video, it appeared to be a spinning ball of white fire.  It appeared as a sphere, but elongated a few times to more cigar shaped.  We were in Gettysburg for my spouse, who is a public official, to receive training at the Emergency Training Center in Emmitsburg.  I have a 5 minute video as well as several still shots.

"UFO OVER ONTARIO, OREGON  I had just left the state park north of Ontario, Oregon and was just crossing over I-84 Highway when I noticed a cool cloud formation, I usually stop to take these kind of pictures besides sunsets.  I pulled off the side of the road and put my window down to take a picture of the cloud formation.  I took only one picture then I got my window up and continued on my way into town and home.  When I got home and parked I looked at the picture and thought it looked cool.  I happen to notice a black dot way over on the bottom left of  the picture.  I expanded the image and noticed it looked like a disc tilted and facing my way when I had taken the picture.  I was excited to have captured this.  Looks like a disc to me.

"Two bright red and white lights moving across the sky in haphazard pattern.  On the night of September 1, 2019, I was staying at the Great Sand Dunes Lodge near Hooper, CO.  From the Lodge you can see huge expanses of sky.  Around 9pm I went outside to look at the night sky which was lit up by stars and planets.  This lodge is one of very few buildings in the area so there was complete silence.  I observed a very bright light looking West.  Then observed two lights, one red, the other white moving slowly and silently in tandem in a northerly direction.  These lights moved together and slowly.  But as they moved they changed direction, moving for a few seconds one way, and then moving in another direction.  I tried photographing this object with a telephoto ens but could not find it in the viewfinder.  I grabbed my cell phone and was able to record about 6 seconds of movement.

"the ufo's that spooked kenneth arnold in 1947  havent gone anywhere....in fact they are quite pleasent to interact with.  Kenneth Arnold Mt. Rainier 1947...l. ((name deleted)) Mt. Rainier :present day: James Gilliland Mt. Adams :present day:   Bright flashes and sharp booms were reported in the skies over Western Washington.  Viewers from Lakewood to Camano Island called KIRO 7 Eyewitness News, saying they were awakened by light or the booms.  Witnesses along a 60-mile swath of the Puget Sound region from the Tacoma area to Whidbey Island and as far as 260 miles to the east said the sky lit up brilliantly, and many reported booms as if from one or more explosions.  Jay Neher, a weather service meteorologist, said the agency's radar on Whidbey Island showed nothing unusual but added that the dish could have been pointed at another part of the sky at the time and could not detect objects above about 20,000 feet.  Civilian pilots reported seeing the flash from Ellensburg, east of the Cascade Range, said an FAA duty officer.  That night was the first night some friends and myself were witnesses to something extraordinary.  Below are a couple pictures of what a few others and myself still see around a discreet location close to Mt. Rainier, Washington.  also there are pictures from the home of James Gilliland in Trout Lake near Mt. Adams which is about 45 miles NE of Rainier.  There have been thousands of eyewitnesses at what is termed ""the sattva sanctuary, www.eceti.org""... some of which are prominent scientists and physicists.  Astro, nuclear, bio, and plasma physicists have all witnessed this oddity.  Aerospace, Air force design engineers, professional photographers and investigators from around the world have also come to observe the anomaoly.  Most all people however, never get a chance to see them at a close proximity, they usually tend to vanish if approached. James and a handful of others, one of which being myself, have been approached by the Luminous Entities.  I now have had many experiences with these entities.  These are not like Ball Lightning or Earthquake Lights, with which they otherwise seem to share many characteristics, these anomalous lights never occur as the result of any obvious trigger event.  Their terrestrial nature means that although many sightings are sporadic, these entities/ufo's are fact.  Trevor James Constable, in a quest to understand better the elusive UFO phenomenon, began using infra-red film in an otherwise ordinary camera.  Constable discovered that ""Infrared film, exposed between dawn and sunrise in high, dry locales will frequently objectify invisible objects of various kinds living in and passing through the atmosphere.  The existence of these organisms seems to be essentially plasmatic, i.e. having their form expressed in heat substance. They travel in pulsatory fashion, swelling and shrinking cyclically as they move through the air..."" ""Being plasmatic, they are capable of returning radar echoes, and often do...Motion pictures we made verify that these plasmatic organisms are capable of velocities and changes in shape and size that render worthless any attempt to handle them with the mechanistic mode of mentation Be they Unidentified Aerial Objects or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, they don't look like machines at all. They look to a biologist horribly like unicelluar lifeforms, complete in some cases with nuclei, nucleoli, vacuoles and all the rest. Some are even amoebic in form....""  Amoebic.  Indeed, it is clear even from the still photographs that these organisms are very like amoebas in shape the bioforms; ""are built of matter of the etheric plane..."" and powered by the life- force, what William Reich calls ""orgone energy"". Their builders are, Constable tells us, a race of intelligent and benign beings, whose world is the same as our world, except it is of a higher vibratory level.  The craft become visible and tangible when they materialise into our own world here are a few places where the events are being seen. Mostly as odd lights on a distant hillside never making any close encounters with watchers and are therefor passed off as natural events of areas with high amounts of energy ""tectonic fault lines"" etc...  Throughout history, mountains, monuments, elevated places, known as “High Places” have usually been associated with God and his revelation to man.  Moses, for example, received the laws on a mountain from God.  Hammurabi also received the Code of Hammurabi from God on a mountain.  The tower of Babel was built to reach heaven.  Legend has it that there was a mountain in the center of Atlantis that reached up to heaven.  We build cathedrals and churches that are structurally very high to symbolize our reaching up to heaven.  The Great Pyramid is one of the highest structures in the world today and was the highest one in ancient times perhaps another stepping stone to...?",
"All I remember is I am looking out a window in my grandmas place then I felt myself thrown on the bed.  My grandma rushed in room because she heard my body hit my bed.    But the story gets weird my mom gives me a book and I see the circular shape craft in the book, but I don't know if I was dreaming it.    Nothing happened afterwards but I don't remember going to lay on my bed.  In fact I don't remember how long anything but seeing the craft and the feeling of being dropped on my bed.  If it was a dream it's a freaky dream.  But why do I recall being dropped in my bed and why would my grandma enter my room wondering what was that sound my body hitting the bed, and why do I remember me looking out the window and seeing the craft.     I still wonder why don't I remember  going to bed to sleep.  I remember no sound from the craft and how low it was flying.  That's all I remember.

"Bright white light from U.F.O.  When I was young boy around 10, I would sleep outside in the summertime to enjoy the cool night.   One night I saw a slender ovular-shaped, bright white light, which seemed to emanate or radiate out from below.  So I figured if I could be underneath it, it would probably look like a saucer (circular) shaped craft.  I also estimate it was really long, because the Uptown are of my Hometown is probably a couple miles from where we lived back then.  I walked up the steps to the new deck to get a better view.  It was just moving across the sky horizontally (over or behind the Uptown hills of my hometown, maybe one hundred feet off the gorun ((sic--ground??)) or more).  Then it stopped, then ascended, until it looked liked it left our atmosphere.  I can't remember now whether it was moving away or going towards Concord Naval Weapons Station.  I still feel bad because to this day I wish I could have waken my Mother and Step-Father, because I could have knocked on their sliding-glass door.  But I was so in awe of this craft, all I could do was stare at this object moving across the sky.  I now think that either it was extra-terrestrial or a Government U.F.O. since Popular Mechanics did an article that said our Government has mini-reactors in these U.F.O.'s and that traces of spent nuclear material has been found where these craft land.

We seemed to know to look up and and for me it knew it was being watched.  My daughter and I were leaving the movies.  I look up and see this intense white fuzzy light (seemed like it was in one of the light clouds)  Its position in the sky was about 2 o'clock to the big dipper handle.    As I watched the light slowly shrunk to a pin size light then nothing.    I turned to my kid and said I just saw a star disappear.  That's when she told me she had been looking at the same big bright fuzzy star but looked away.    After I told her how it vanished she looked back to the same place she was looking.  Just to see nothing there any more.  To me it seemed it knew it was noticed.    This happened at the circle center mall back exit in the east side of Saskatoon.,

Out of the clouds came some lightness and to me it was a clearing in the sky and should be seeing the moon but instead there was no moon it was long and ship wise shaped not a boat.  It came out even more and had a length to it.  After seeing it show its true self....blue lights off to the side of it became noticeable and these blue lights ran off to the side of what I called the ship.  Toward the end the blue lights went slender and had some length to them. It looked to me as these vessels were sent or released out of this ship because they were smaller in size to scope the area.  The blue lights were a vibrant blue not a dark color very vibrant, radiant color compared to this vessel they occupied the outside.",
"Several years ago, my husband and I was setting out on the back porch under a awning on a swing, late night.  The object appeared from the North east at a high rate of speed.  There was a floresent electracil light from the back of the object and there was no sound other than a swish.    It came to a complete stand still over our back yard and we were surprised.  The object was triangle in shape and the green light slowly went out and a floresent white light was across the front.    After looking at it for a few minutes and wondering what it was I stood up.    You could see it rock back and forth but still no sound.  Shortly after I stood up the lights went out just like someone turned them off.  It still stayed over our back yard for a few more minutes then we heard another swish and it took off really fast.    It went north west toward Goodfellow Air Force Base.  I do not know how it could stay still up there without falling other than the rocking motion, might have had someting to do with it.  I am still wondering what it could have been.    It was dark so I could not tell what the bottom of it looked like, only the outline of it.    We both didn't think anyone would believe this so I told only family up to this point. Not easy to put in a summary.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

"Close encounter of the third kind mid 1980's  My close encounter of the third kind in the mid 1980’s  I decided to send in my story for a couple of reasons. First, because I almost died from a major heart attack last year that required triple bypass, emergency surgery on both lungs and kidney failure. I am still recuperating to this day. And second because I know what happened that night was real and I feel that it should be remembered and put on record. Please forgive me, I am not a writer and will do the best I can with telling what I remember as it was a long time ago. Dates and times are approximate but the experience is well remembered.  This incident happened around  midnight or a little later in the morning one night in 1984 0r 85. I remember being awaken by sounds that seemed like they were coming from the kitchen. Of course I was startled and did not know if maybe one of my young sons were in the kitchen or if it was a burglar. Also, I wasn’t sure what the humming sound was  that I was hearing and decided I needed to get up and investigate.  As I was going to pull back the covers to get out of bed, It was then that I realized that I couldn’t move. I was frozen as if I was paralyzed from head to toe! I tried to turn my head to wake up my wife. I couldn’t turn my head or even call out to her. I couldn’t even speak. The only thing I could move were my eyes so needless to say, I was pretty much terrified at this point.  We kept the vent light on above the stove so we, and our oldest son, could see and be able to get  down the hallway to the bathroom at night. As I was laying on my back and looking at the light shining on the hall wall, I noticed shadow movement that made me realize that someone, or something was in the kitchen and  moving down the hall toward our bedroom. Our sons bedroom was directly across the hall from ours.  At this point two of the beings walked to my sons opened door and looked in, without turning on the light, and one came into our bedroom. They were about four feet tall and looked like the grey ET’s that I’ve seen as described on TV since this incident. Then one who looked similar to the other three, except was about a foot taller, walked in followed by the two that were at my kids door a minute earlier.  Even though I didn’t hear anything except for the continued humming noise, it looked to me like they were communicating to each other and even using hand motions to each other. After moment of this, one of them walked to my left side, one to my right side and one to my feet. The taller one stayed back by the bedroom door. They held something like a scanner, about the size of a cell phone, holding them a couple inches above and went up and down my body, including my neck and head, for maybe a minute.  The last I remember from that visit was the three shorter beings following the taller one out of the bedroom and down the hall. The next thing I remember was being awakened by the alarm clock to get ready for work at daylight. Of course the first thing I wanted to do was ask my wife if she remembered anything that happened the night before but she was still asleep when I left for work. And though I wanted to, I was too scared of what people might think of me to tell anybody at work about what happened. When I told my wife about it after work, she couldn’t and wouldn’t believe any of it. That’s when I decided to keep it to myself. This is a TRUE story and it happened!",
"It was so short, it had to be real. It was unlike anything I have ever witnessed and I was not frightened.  I was sleeping on the floor next to my bedroom window at approx 11-13 years of age b/c it was so hot that summer night.  I somewhat forget because I was so traumatized as to my exact age and since I was asleep I cannot tell you the exact time of night it was.    A sound is what woke me up...I looked out the window to a bright blue-ish/neon-ish disk shaped --- UFO-- for lack of a better word. It make a whirling sound and hovered hundreds of yards away.  I was mezmerized.   I tried to to yell for my sister who was sleeping in the room below me (I was in the attic).  I couldn't talk or make a sound. I was frozen in my spot, but I was not scared.  And I can't even watch a scary movie or a horror movie.  Even deep dramas freak me out.    This is the last thing I remember.... until the next am; I told my mom and she didn't disbelieve me. I told her exactly what I said here and she said something along the lines of ""your story sounds like other's who have reported the same things..  And other people have said they can't speak after seeing an UFO,either""... strange but true.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

"Around 1am, I was standing on patio when I noticed light changing effect form a object hovering with a slight ascent.  Then what seemed to be 2 shooting stars came striking by towards tne object.  It slowly moved southwest.  I thought i was crazy till I layed down and I couldn't sleep as I was trying to wrap my brain around what it may of been.    Went back after a hr or so the object was now back but higher this time.  As i took pics and recorded till pbone died.  I noticed a smaller and light blinking.  Second object was hovering off the shore.  It seemed to be same allatatude as the first.  I saw then the 3rd one almost the same distance from the brighter object as the other.

"It has been a long time ago and I've tried to get help. It was early Saturday morning. I was going to Lansing iowa, was going duck hunting later.  Anyway, I was going around a curve when the sky lit up. It was south of me, a blue white tongue of fire, kind of reminded me of when you see a rocket land, how the flame come out the bottom. I could see this thing slowing down as the intensity of the flame increased. This thing slowed down to almost not moving and disappeared behind a ridge and trees. This thing was at least a mile away. It was big. Sorry, that's all I can remember. I did contact the Postville pice to inquire as to whether a plane crashed and was told no. I know I saw something.

"A ball of light, lighting up my pitch dark room..  A few years ago,myself and a friend who was sleeping over,were chatting away in our beds. We had turned off the light and were talking in total darkness.all of the sudden,her face and the rest of my bedroom was totally lit up and we could see each other perfectly.we both jumped up with fright and looked straight out the window,where we saw  something that seemed to be a ball of slightly blue light hovering just outside my window. in distance it would have been near the middle of my garden and in height,just above the roof of the house.we froze as we looked at it and after about a good five to six seconds,it shot off extremely fast.we then were left in a darkend room again. Neither of us have any idea of what it could have been and we regularly wonder about it.My dad suggested it could have been a fireball,but it was totaly soundless. it's not like there's many people you can tell this kind of thing to,so i dont really bother(even though i want to tell everyone)but i would love to hear from somebody who could tell me what it could have been. the curiosity hasn't faded in the last few years and i don't think it ever will.

Moving light  Small star like light but moved erratically or in sort of zig zag motion. I tried to upload 3 videos I have as proof but system or button here for such not working my end.,
heard a helicopter flashing redlights and in front of it spaced evenly were 4 bright green orbs going east  before I could run outside to get a further look they had disappeared behind some trees. I wouldn't say the helicopter was chasing these just escorting them,

stagnent orange ball of light that went from small to big  i was woke up by a loud choppter/jet sound. looked out my window and there was a stagnent bright orange light in the sky. the sounds stopped then i could hear car alarms going off. the object seemed to be in one place. i woke my little brother up so i could make sure what i was seeing. so i took a photo and a video. you can see its in the sky as the street light posts are really low,
"An array of green pulsing light that condensed into a mass object  Headed to work as usual headed down Hwy 2, just passed the last house before you start heading up the east side of Stevens pass. As I approach the grade heading up Rayrock, an intense green light array appeared and started pulsing. It was just above the tree tops and probably was the length of a football field. The light was flat on the bottom, but it projected upward in an irregular pattern. Then it sudden condensed into a roundish mass of green light, and slowly traveled parallel with the ground. I had a visual for about 3-4 seconds, but due to the topography in that area it went out of sight. At first I thought it was a transformer that exploded but there is no overhead power in that area. It was crystal clear out and the stars where visible.",

"Spotted a blue object streaking across the sky from north to south.  I was sitting outside my house as there was a prowler in the neighborhood and police had been searching, I have a very large open field across the road from my home and I was scanning the field for the prowler, suddenly I saw a blue oval shaped object streaking across the sky, this was not like any shooting star I have ever seen before and it was not high enough to be a shooting star, it was no more than a half mile up above the tree line it did not.make.any noise as it streaked across the sky, I knew it was not a plane or a helicopter because it was. moving to fast and it was blue at the front of it and it had orange/yellow on the back end of of it it did not have a tail like a shooting star and it was headed from north to south towards the straight of Juan de fuca it was.moving to fast for a drone and made no noise I could only follow it for a short distance because it disappeared behind the trees. I have never seen anything like this before and I know the difference between a satellite and shooting stars. It was a very bright blue color and it did not appear to be slowing or breaking up, I made a call to the local police RCMP west shore and made a report to them as well. Again it was very low in the sky and clearly was not something I have ever seen before",

"Bright light fell from sky, numerous beings descended onto my roof via a shroud of clouds and I was violated sexually, lost 8 hours.  On March 7, 2022 I was sitting in my backyard in Jacksonville, FL and a white star-like light fell from the sky and a few minutes later a group of beings that seemed hybrid in nature descended on my roof. They flew upright holding a long whip-like devise that is red and white striped. It appeared to be tied around waist and somehow helped to generated the cloud covering. They have metal devices over their nose that connect to ear on one side.  The lights they carry are incredibly bright. Some carry a 3-pronged striped wand of sorts. I was approached from behind, something was put over my nose and mouth, I passed out. I woke up 8 hours later and while I felt euphoric I also had been violated in the rectum area which is not something I would have agreed to. I have been celebrate for 8 years. I also have strange bruising on left arm. One hole is from the nurse but the others cannot all be from a bandaide .  I have had experiences with unknown beings since 11/7/2021. Some are hollographic in nature, some look human, others are like nothing I have ever seen. I have been shot at since 11/7/21 with a device that flies from the sky, through our roof shingles, through the house and into my body creating small holes. I have burn holes that go through my new mattress. There are holes in various things. They also shoot something onto our walls that leaves two fine strands of fiber if steamed properly to view the dots they leave behind. Is it some type of surveillance?  I have also had peaceful encounters. Since this started our attic has been cleared of most all insullation and I hear movement that is much bigger than a rodent often. If this is a hoax or gaslighting then the source deserves an Oscar!  I have called the police many times and they Baker Acted me over it- everyone thinks I am crazy. I am not! Help. They were above my home again last night 3/16/22.  I have plenty of photos and video, but was not able to upload to phone.",

"Spherical orb moving very fast with unnatural speed and varying brightness.  Myself (48), my oldest (22) and my youngest (19) had just gotten slushies for my youngest’s 19th birthday and were parked in a Costco parking lot. We were sitting in our car talking. My youngest was sitting in the back and noticed a strange light through the panoramic moonroof. At first he thought it was a star, but it moved. Then he thought it was a satellite, but it changed in brightness and direction. That’s when he brought it to our attention. By the time we started filming, it had already changed direction 5 times. It moved from a close distance to maybe a mile away almost instantly. It also would grow incredibly bright, fade, disappear and even strobe. In the video it was in the sky to the North, most likely over the Columbia river. It was moving at a speed and direction that would be impossible with our technology. It seemed to be between 100 feet and 2000 feet in elevation. Movements were very fluid and slow to lightning fast. After watching it for several minutes, it seemed to fade into the distance to the North which would put it at a speed of at least 3 times the speed of our aircraft. We see Coast Guard helicopters and local aircraft all the time. This was nothing like anything we had seen before. We had no doubt this was a UFO.",

"Random light shows up moving strangely and no bright stars in sight.  I looked out the window and out of nowhere a random light pops out of nowhere. I quickly got up to look more carefully; I did freak out a little and woke my boyfriend up so he could tell me if he was seeing the same. The light looked like it was trying to stay in one spot but i could kinda see it moving around up,down,and to the sides like if it was trying to stay still. I knew this was an odd object because I’ve never seen anything like it in my location. The light was kind of glistening. I did start recording just a few seconds after realizing. I took separate videos but you can definitely tell that it’s moving. In the videos you can see a that theres a light post and in each video you can see the light that it moved positions. At one point i realized the light was kinda fading away and it would come back. I did start recording because after a while staring at it i was feeling dizzy and wasn't sure if i was losing sight. But in the last video you can see it fading and then disappear. And like i said there wasn't any bright stars in sight but just that light.",

"While flying in a USN EA-18G @ 20k, we saw a large bright white glowing orb flying toward us, getting brighter on a collision course  My pilot and I had just finished training in the Boardman Target Complex MOA in Northern Oregon (near the Dalles). At 7pm Local time, we departed the airspace to the Northwest at 20,000' MSL, headed for NAS Whidbey Island. At approximately 705pm, my pilot asked me what the bright light at 10 o'clock was. I looked out and saw a large white glowing orb at what looked to be maybe 5-7 miles. As we studied it, it started moving on what looked like a collision course with us, and at co-altitude. It got about twice as bright during this time. We then asked ATC for a climb to 24k because we were worried it would collide with us. We received permission to climb and described the position to ATC as we were looking at it, but ATC said they had nothing visible at all on radar. After ATC said that, the craft seemed to drop quickly below the undercast cloud layer at 18k below us. We did not see it again after that.",

Sorry the video is very grainy as it was at night and I zoomed in as much as I could while filming. Thanks",

Very strange colored lights seen moving fast over lake ontario  I was on my ribs inflatable dingy heading out of the Port of frenchmans Bay at around 930pm.While looking south over the lake I first saw an orange glow almost like a flare. Then 5 minutes later at about 20 NM distance I saw a similar light moving at a very high rate of speed heading to the west. It changed colors from white to green then blue and purple all very quickly all in a moment. This thing moved fast and upon looking at Google maps covered a distance of 5 or so NM all in an instant. Nothing know of moves that fast. The colors changed as it got faster and faster. Then it was gone. I did get a picture but it's unusable. Very strange definatly not an aircraft or flare but rather something strange.,

"Very unusual light appeared above mountain ridge, stabilized then continued slowly up and out of camera view  Our weather live stream camera (plus a second camera that was recording timelapse footage) caught a large oval light, northeast across the Boulder Valley from our location, rising slowly from the ridge of the Elkhorn Mountains and up, until out of the camera view. The timestamp from the camera footage indicates first appearance at 6:10am on Tuesday March 9th, 2022, which was 500 seconds after the camera started recording, completely disappearing before 6:14am. The sun hadn't yet come over the horizon, so the light showed up quite brightly in the left 1/3 of the sky, above the mountain ridge, which is approx 12 miles from our location. The light orb moved very slowly; there was no way it was a jet or plane crossing at high altitude. We first thought it was a searchlight from a search and rescue helicopter. It initially seems to blink and 'tumble', then disappears momentarily before continuing. It seemed to maintain an upward trajectory. It took 180 seconds (3 minutes), from when it first blinked into view before it eventually disappeared from camera view. I don't know if it originated from the ridge, or from beyond the ridge, or if it was actually high in the atmosphere and only became visible as it got closer to our location. This light/object appeared to be headed 'up', but if it was actually on a lateral trajectory is was travelling from Northeast to Southwest - this rules out the ISS or any other equatorial satellites. I submitted an email and the video links to NOAA and asked if it could possibly be a polar weather satellite, but they have not responded even yet, six weeks later. So I assume it isn't one of theirs?? I am an amateur weather nerd and maintain two cameras pointed Northeast to obtain weather footage that I upload to YouTube. There are two videos on my YouTube account (hunt1803) that document this sighting. One is Youtube's archive of the 12 hour livestream, recording the sighting in real time. The sighting starts at 500 seconds into the video, then continues for 180 seconds before disappearing. The other is a time lapse recording of event, taken at 1 frame every 6 seconds, so the light naturally appears as a streak near the beginning. In real time, the light initially blinks on, get brighter, then seems to disappear in haze before reappearing and starting its slow climb. I've attached shortened clips that we managed to take from YouTube's archive, but after processing the quality is VERY POOR. Much better quality for both videos is available on the YouTube account. If you are able, for the real time recording go directly to the livestream archive on YouTube, which I've cued to start just before the light appears, at: https://youtu.Be/o-um9-meb0u?T=500 The full, much higher quality time lapsed video is at https://youtu.Be/umharf3lthm I would be interested in finding out if anyone else saw this, or if it matches a schedule for launching some kind of weather balloon, or military balloon, or what??",

"Daytime sighting of black craft  I deliver propane to rural areas in the San Bernardino mountains. While I was filling a customer’s tank I observed a small dark speck directly under the sun and over Santa Rosa mountain. I tried to focus on this small speck to see if it was moving but it appeared to be stationary. I was thinking to myself that whatever this object was, I wish I could get a better look at it. The very next moment a large (maybe 40-60 ft long) black rectangular shaped object just appeared directly in my field of vision (in between myself and the mountain). The object was black and extremely bright white light emanated from the bottom. It seemed to me that I was observing the object edge-wise so I can’t exactly say what shape it was but from my perspective it appeared rectangular. The object moved a short distance and disappeared as suddenly as it appeared. Even though the close-up portion of this sighting only lasted a few seconds, it shocked and even frightened me a bit. I’ve had several other night time sightings in these mountains but this was my first day time sighting.",

Driving on 54 West fwy saw a large golden orange light flash twice southbound before disappearing. 10x larger than other aircraft in the sky that night. It happened so fast but I saw it directly ahead of me lighting up the surrounding clouds. It looked like it was in a lower altitude than commercial aircraft but it was moving from north to south across the highway. Two bursts of light and then it disappeared. It was different from a flare or floating lantern as those would be visible for longer time.,

Mimicking the undulation of a snake or dragon. The group of them was heading north. They were flying close enough that we could see them pretty clearly, but I’m not sure of the actual elevation.

"Light moving L to R in sky above mountains, NNE of my location. After a short bit it just vanished.  My wife and I were driving NB on I-25 near Contreras, NM. I noticed a white light at about 020 relative position from my direction of travel. It was at about 20 degrees above the horizon and above the mountains to the NE. I thought it to be a small plane, but there were no flashing lights, just a steady white light. I felt my windshield and distance might be why I saw no flashing lights. My wife noticed it about five minutes after I first saw it. She thought it might be an early evening star, but as she started asking me about it, it just vanished. We both felt it was very odd and we could still make out the mountains, so we know it didn’t go behind them. It seemed to bright and slow to have been a distant satellite, which we see a lot of from our home in Upper Michigan.  It may be nothing, but it was odd enough for me to report, just in case there are other reports from this time period or a similar described sighting.

"I took 4 pics of the Empire state building while waiting for a green light - next day I noticed 6 orbs in 2 pics in different positions  It was raining and there was a lot of mist or fog and the Empire State Building was lit up and had a nice pinkish glow to it so I took 4 pictures of it while waiting for a light at 5:34 on Feb 4th (was on the way to a social gathering). The first picture was in portrait mode and brought the image too close, so I went to photo mode and focused on the Empire State Building and took 3 more shots. The second and third shot were a 1X magnification and the 4th was a closer magnification. The next day I checked the photos on my iPad and I saw there were 6 white orbs around or beyond the top of the Empire State building. The 2nd and 3rd pics were a few seconds apart and it was apparent the orbs had changed positions, possibly moving NE and their relative positions had changed and the brightness changed slightly possibly as it was heavily misty. I did not see them in the 4th picture or the 1st picture. So this all passed over in probably less than 30 seconds. The glare from the Building light was so bright I didn’t noticed the orbs at the time and I can understand why this might have not been noticed by anyone on the ground.",
"UFO seen while I was in an outdoor yoga class staring up at the sky  While staring up at the sky in the savasana position (lying down) in Leahi Park, Honolulu (visiting from NYC) I noticed a dark shape (I think oval) but it had a fire on the undercarriage much like an air balloon would have but the fire was large and took up most of the object. The object was far higher than a plane (there was a plane not too far away) and did not remotely appear to be an air balloon which would explain the fire. Because of the fire, it was difficult to see the object. I had my phone with me so I tried to videotape it, but my iPhone 12 was not good enough to see the object, I could only see sky. The class was deeply silent because everyone was doing savasana so I thought it would be very inappropriate to call out to ask if anyone else saw it. I thought I would ask when the class ended. But then the fireball under the carriage of the object went out and the object (dark, sort of an oval-ish shape) began to fade. I couldn't tell if it was just fading or if it was retreating even higher into the sky. At that point, it disappeared. No sound, no ""lights"" but it was definitely fire. The nearby plane appeared to be a general commercial airline and had nothing to do with the object.  Investigator free to contact me but not necessary.",

"At 1:30 AM to 7:30 AM in the eastern sky witnessed multiple spheres with orbiting red lights moving slow followed by a flash in the sky  At 1:30 AM I looked out my living room window at what I thought was a star, but, then noticed that the star was slowly moving diagonally upward to the north west, I observed this for about half an hour, when I began to observe the ""star"" closer I could see it was not one light but 2 possibly 3 lights, the central bigger white sphere being orbited by a much smaller white sphere and red sphere, I then called my girlfriend into the living room to look at the ""star"" I suggested nothing, but told her to just look at it for 5 minutes, she then told me that the ""star"" was moving and was being orbited by a much smaller red light, she left the room and about 5 minutes later I witnessed a huge flash in the sky like an electrical explosion moving north to south across the sky it left a brief light signature in the sky, I yelled for my girlfriend but by the time she got there the light signature had dissipated. I continued to watch the sphere for 6 hours and make the following observations, tiny specs of light appeared to move away from the sphere and towards the sphere, as it progressed slowly to the north east I observed similar spheres to the lower left and lower right of the object they were not as bright but moved in the same manner, at this point my eyes were getting tired but I could swear I was seeing faint lines of light occasionally connecting the spheres as the whole ""assembly"" moved slowly to the north east. I know for sure that I observed occasional flashes in the sky and barley perceptible distortions of light around the brightest sphere. After really concentrating on the object I could see that the sphere was actually surrounded by a black circle and that if it moved across a cloud it would cover it and that the sphere was moving within the circle like an iris in an eyeball. I signaled the object with my cell phone light several times each time I did so it would stop moving and hold it's position before slowly proceeding to the north east. The objects proceeded in that direction stopping periodically as if repeatedly performing some sort of function, it seemed to me it was mapping out the sky. I watched the objects move farther and farther to the north east as the sun came up, the spheres to the bottom left and bottom right of the brightest sphere eventually became too dim to see and the brightest sphere kept moving so far away by the time the sky was completely illuminated by the sun the object was no longer visible, as I said to myself ""ok shows over"" a jet appeared from the south west and moved extremely fast in the same north easterly direction as the object leaving a chemtrail behind.",
"A flash of green light lit the whole sky then a circular lit up aircraft came we thought it was a plane but it made no noise and didn't  We were coming home from a very late basketball game, it was just me and my dad, I was in the back seat because the front was crowded with stuff. As we were driving my dad came to a sudden stop I asked why, due to the fact that there was no stop sign and no traffic lights for miles. My dad reported seeing a huge flash of green light that lit up the sky and it couldn’t have been another car because there were none around the entire drive. We kept driving trying to forget what my dad had seen. About twenty minutes later it was about 10:07 at night (that’s what I remember) a strange saucer like object with lights around the edges was spotted by me this time, I showed my dad. “It’s just a plane” my dad told me, but I don’t think it was, it was making no noise at all and wasn’t moving, all of a sudden a bright light shown down ascending to the ground. We had stopped to look at it, and my dad wouldn’t believe it was a UFO…he didn’t want to believe it but he knows it probably was. We kept driving and I kept my eyes on the saucer like object, I looked back at my dad and said “it’s still there” he stoped the car again and I stuck my head out the window. The saucer was gone",
Rolling bright light in the sky . Fast.  I was taking photos of a pretty beam effect the snow was having on larger lights . While taking a photo a bright ball of light came into view and rolled thru the sky. It was only a brief time but I managed to snap three pics as the camera was already up . You can see it move in one pic because the camera was on live mode.,
"Almost blinding to look at. It was cloudy, there were no stars in the sky visible. I took pictures.  I went to take my dog out and I noticed how bright this was, I got out my phone and took pictures. When I zoomed it it had a greenish smoky ring around it with an orangish circle in the center. I went back inside about 10-15 minutes later to get my fiance and when we came out it was no longer visible. I have photos.",

Second witness filmed, and quality is not the best but snippets of UAP can be seen in bottom right corner of video, 0:16-0:18 seconds in, next to a small break in the clouds. This sighting spanned about 5 minutes before the UAP quickly went behind clouds for final time. The sky then darkened into nightfall not long after.",

"I work ATC at GEG international airport. I know what planes and satellites in the sky are supposed to look like.  Went outside to let my dogs out and saw these lights in the sky moving in erratic directions. Clearly not a satellite, and not a plane. Their movement while did have some level of pattern to it, was rather erratic. I could not see any beam of light that might explain their origin, and even if there was, I find it doubtable that someone is shining 4 spotlights in the sky at 3:30 in the morning on a Wednesday. I was able to record the event, though the footage does not fully capture their luminosity. I am perplexed by this phenomenon. Yesterday, my local news network showed a video of the same event happening the night prior, but with more clarity then my video. I’m not the only one who witnessed these lights, and I feel it is worth submitting an entry.",
"Pulsating light doing 90 turns and zig zags before shooting off then disappearing  Driving to work I noticed what I thought was an airplane until I noticed no aviation lights, just a pulsating white light like a star. I noticed it between 2 stars before it started moving. It would get very bright then real dim. I slowed down to watch it then noticed it started moving. Very slowly at first, then gaining speed. I started watching as it started to make a couple sharp 90° turns and I knew it wasn't an airplane. It took off very fast then slowed down and done a couple zig zag maneuvers before it stopped. Once it stopped it sat for 2-3 seconds before just disappearing but i never seen it fly off, it just vanished. I didn't have time to get my phone to take any pictures or videos. It was only 1 craft that I noticed. I've never had any experience like this before. I'm an avid stargazer and have no reports of any mental health issues in my family. I'm a healthy 29 year old male with no medical or mental health issues. There has been 1 other UFO sighting in my same small town back in the 1980's that I know of. Very strange sighting and have seen a couple stories of the exact same lights in other places.",
"A star-like object seen flitting around at 8am. It got closer & I was able to get pics. At 8pm a LG ship which morphed several x seen.  A 7am morning sky was busy with military aircraft & a grand array of contrails as far as my 11 year old daughter's & my eyes could see. Leaving my neighborhood, we spotted a lightning bolt-like imprint from mid-sky to the ground in a field nearby. I parked at a place I knew the view could be vast. At 8 am, as multitudes of jets & US Gov aircraft flew back & forth, a star-like object was seen flitting around. It then got closer & I was able to get several photos. They show an oval-like shape with 3 rectangular lights, but each image looks a bit different. That could be because it was a ""lightship"" and/or because it was moving so quickly. The skies were busy with jets & planes all day. In my backyard at 8pm, I witnessed what looked like a large dark ship, oval or rounded square, with changing lights, stationed above the horizon. I got in my car in hopes that I would get to it. On my drive, my daughter counted 23 jets. I noticed that the closer I thought I got to the ship, the smaller it became. I originally thought that was because it was moving further away, but then realized that it was also changing locations in the sky. As jets got closer to it, it would quickly move locations, as if in the speed of light. It also seemed to morph into different shapes & the changing colors were brilliant & bright. I am a channel for information and light language between realms or higher dimensions, so this has been exciting for me. Here is video documentation of everything. https://youtu.be/V2iR0UMpWUc",

4 yellow speres flying east managed to record one of them  One was recorded,
"A brightly lit triangle with many yellow lights on perimiter and interior of craft surface.  We were traveling on Hemlock Farms Road in a community called Hemlock Farms in a town called Lords Valley. The road was going South west. To our left side, we saw an object about a dime's length in size out our driver side window going somewhat faster than the car but not exceedingly so. It was fairly big as far as a signature goes. The sighting began at exactly 7:37 PM as we looked at the dashboard clock. We are seasoned observers and do not submit reports nilly-willy. It eventually pulled very far ahead of us in the course of one to two minutes. It was a triangle. It had all yellow lights. The lights were along the front two lengths of the object. About 4 on each side. And there were at least 4 more lights in what would be the body of the craft behind the before mentioned perimeter lights. It was bright! The object was fairly low so that is why we perceived it as a dime sized object which is fairly large as far as sightings go. No FRA green or red lights. All yellow. Total about 10 to 12 yellow lights. The pattern was like a ike a Christmas tree traveling on its side. It had an inordinate amount of lights on it. It was not perceived by anyone in the car as a normal aircraft. Maximum speed probably under 100 mph based on how fast it gradually pulled ahead of us at our speed of 40 mph. We looked it up on Flightradar24.com. We began the search at 7:15 pm. local time (5 hours earlier than UTC time). There were no aircraft over the location 15 minutes before or prior. Thus, this object did not have a transponder. It was high enough above the radar line that it should show up on flightradar24. Based on our position, and the low perceived altitude, we take a ball park guess that the object was larger than a large heli and smaller than a Boeing 737. Windows closed so we heards no engines.  My dad is a UFO Investigator with MUFON . He was with me when I saw this. He agreed it was unusual and told me our area is ripe with UFO reports including triangles this year. Apparently there are corresponding MUFON and NUFORC reports of this type of object in our area in the past 12 months. He is always free to contact. No anonymity required. Thank you! Liam!",
"Fireball appearance coming towards me, 3 points of orange light when it turned and moved away from me  Object moved slowly, low in the sky moving south to north. It appeared to be a fireball meteor over downtown Excelsior Springs. The object turned to the east and ascended slowly and when it did, the orange lights were in a triangle shape. 3 points of light glowing orange. Slowly ascended and disappeared and I could hear no sound. I would have flown directly over The Elms hotel and downtown Excelsior Springs so hopefully there are other reports. I saw this at 9:15pm",
"Basically the “star” turned to many stars around it as in like a circle but then it started expanding to like a ufo ship.  Wednesday December 1st, 2021 Occurred around 6:40pm -7:20pm  I believe I saw a ufo. Previous experience of seeing something coming strait at me fast while outside this light but it vanished quickly into thin air like it’s crazy. I didn’t think nothing of it. But that’s not why I’m here. I recorded off a voice memo like a voice message as soon as I got back inside after seeing what I saw. I don’t know how to explain it but ima do my best writing it down.  First the star I was looking at I knew it wasn’t a star because previously I saw it blinked like a red color & some other color but all I remember was red. But that same “star” had me stuck while I was staring at it. Like it made me feel weightless as if I was levitating. But that’s the thing the more I was looking at the “star” it kept getting closer, and closer and closer.  Like spreading out to many dots around it then had sticks on the outside after connecting. It’s weird Ik but that’s what happened. But before I was in like a trance like stuck like daydreaming, all Ik is that it felt like home. Like peace so I teared up a bit I’m not gone lie. Like when ppl die they feel peace that’s what I heard and that what it felt like. Peace, calming.  I went back inside the house hurried up n wrote what I saw but I had this overly sensation of a body high like my body was stretching it was so crazy but I felt like I could’ve died. It had me paranoid. And the more I tried to write what I saw it’s like I couldn’t even write like it was so hard to even do it. It’s crazy.  So I looked up what to do & then I said ima record what I saw in a voice memo/ message just in case the next day I don’t remember what I saw & felt. I drew this picture of what I saw as well on the paper I written on.  Idk if I can send the voice memo as well so I just described it the best I could.",

Orange fireball moving East to West  Orange fireball with pulsating yellow light in center. Siting last 25 seconds. First appeared to be a jet on fire!,
"Parallel lights in east nearly overhead  First, I looked on line to locate a UFO site to make a report, I became discouraged as the sites I found seemed to be complicated and had their own agenda. A couple of days ago my wife was talking to a friend who is retired from US Navy Intelligence telling my incident and she said look again on line and make a report. So, I located your site.  On December 2 2021, 620pm I walked to our community mailbox a few houses from ours and across the street. This is in a northwest direction.  Upon getting our mail and walking to return home in a southeast direction I normally look to the south and observe the exisiting planets and stars if visible. This night a couple of planets were visible, I believe Jupiter and Saturn. I then scanned toward the east above the two-story homes and slightly overhead. What caught my eye was an object in this direction (east) appeared to be 6 to 8 white lights in two parallel rows, it is now 624pm (according to the camera phone photo). I stopped to observe the lighted object. I could not tell if this was one object or multiple. As tight as the lights were, I would say one object. Absolutely no sound or blinking lights were observed from this object. I tucked the mail under my left arm, took my phone out with my right hand, activated the phone and snapped a photo which of course it turned out blurry since I had the phone camera in an exposure mode that delayed completion of the photo. I should have activated the video. As this was happening, from the east - northeast we had a very high layer of cloud cover approaching the object. I trotted to the house to get my wife to step out to the back patio and observe this, however the object was gone or hidden by the cloud cover.  Total observation time was 1 minute.  My wife looked on the site Next Door to see if any reports of lights had been reported, none have been.",
"We saw orange orbs of light, turn on in sequence in a diamond shape- probably 20 feet apart each in a 1,2,3,4 pattern.  Cameron, my friend and I were hanging out watching tv when i received a phone call. I stepped out on my balcony to take the call. Leaning out looking over my balcony to the ocean i saw a twinkling light, like a sparkle. I saw one, then two, and then 4 sparkling lights. I yelled to cameron to come bring his phone and start recording as i'd never seen lights like that. As he started recording each sparkling white light turned bright orange one after another in a perfect diamond pattern then disappeared in the same order. No sound and no sight of it again.",
"A line of 50 lights evenly paced moving west to east, San Francisco Bay Area CA  At around 9:20 PM my wife and I were on our deck and saw a line of lights in the sky, perfectly spaced, moving west to east. We saw approximately 50 of them go by, evenly paced. They were too far away to see a shape. I took a video.",
"A long formation of lights across the lower Northern sky, flying straight and evenly spaced that lasted for several minutes.  We were at our cabin in the mountains and getting ready to leave. As we approached our car, I noticed in the northern sky, just above the tree line a string of lights flying in a straight line from West to East. They were evenly spaced and all going about the same speed. I would normally think it would be a satellite, but there were so many of them.  This ""parade"" or formation of lights lasted for several minutes, I would say at least 3 minutes. They faded and gradually disappeared as they headed East. There had to be over 100 ""lights"". Eventually they stopped, but it was a very consistent formation, a straight line of lights all flying across the sky (not falling like a meteor, or space debris) They were too far away to see any shape or color Although I am somewhat skeptical of UFO's, I don't disbelieve. This is definitely the first time I have ever made any type of report.  My background: I have a college education, am over 60 yrs old and do not drink alcohol or do drugs.",
"It was like watching a hundred lights marching off to war, single file  Lights following each other, nearly equidistant from each other, from west to east over Grand Lake. First saw 14 lights at 10k ft moving in a steady straight line. Ten minutes later there were many more in following a similar path all in line. I couldn't see where the lights originated through the trees but they vanished over the lake to the east. They traveled like the speed of satellites in the night sky, but were much closer. Soundless. My phone went to emergency only mode during the parade of lights and stayed in emergency mode for an hour after.",
"We saw 50 unidentifiable flying objects approximately 8 miles above the standard landing flight pattern for the Bay Area.

The array of lights, which I thought were drones, which were to high to be drones were in a close to pattern like formation.  They flew in from the west, disappeared and then two minutes later showed up at a 90 degree angle turning to fly south..   My wife is already finding posts on Facebook about what we witnessed, it’s crazy.",
"Vertically aligned lights moving across the sky in a constant straight line  On May 7 my dad was outside as he normally gets up to look around at night. He went by my window and called me out to “look at these weird stars”. We always tend observe the sky to see if we see something odd, this time he did. He then showed me what he was looking at and described the lights as “moving stars going in a circle”. I began to notice it was about 3 circular lights that kept moving at a right upward angle across the sky. As we kept watching, the lights had seemed to move at a further distance but you can the were all aligned to a vertical angle. No matter what direction the objects went, they maintained aligned.  The lights in the video are shown coming from the left side of the screen next to the palm tree.  Explanation: Starlink - Possible",

"I was talking to my brother on my cell phone on my front porch with my wife. I looked up to the stars and off to the left I noticed dozens of lights moving rapidly in a straight line and disappearing at what seemed like the same fixed point in the sky. (I later told my wife I wonder if they were disappearing into an invisible or unseen ""mothership"") I told my wife and we both watched for a minute or so as I attempted to tell my brother what we were seeing. A moment later my wife went inside to tell our older son. They came out to watch the last dozen or so lights disappear at the same spot in the sky. All of the lights seemed to be the same brightness traveling in almost a straight line but not perfectly. The closest thing I could relate it to would be if a stationary aircraft were to shoot tracers in the sky at something else in the sky and the tracers burnt out at the exact location without fading out but instantly extinguishing at the same point! in the sky and the ""tracers"" did not fall due to gravity in fact they seemed to follow a very straight path. I have been in Marine Corps aviation for 20 years and have flown in large formations but never in a straight line like that. I was a crew chief on CH-46's and MV-22's and performed air to ground and air to air gunnery and we would never shoot air to air in any possibly populated area.",

"116 orbs in total traveling the three groups equally spaced apart and traveling at the same speed not following the horizon  My wife and I were camping at Bothe-Napa, sitting around the campfire looking up at the stars off and on. The sky was very clear, and through the tree openings we first spotted a row of orbs (same size as a singular satellite you would see cruising by). There were 8 orbs on the first pass, equally distanced apart from each other moving at the exact same speed from left to right, about 6 to 7 seconds apart from each other.   After the 8 orbs passed and brief moment went by before another another row of orbs began traveling along the same path. Each equally distanced from each other and moving at the same speed. We counted 49 orbs in this group. There were many trees so we could not see beginning or end of their travel (this info will come into play later).   After another brief moment a third group of orbs appeared only this time they were traveling perfectly perpendicular to the previous groups. Again, each equally distanced and moving at the same speed. At this point I decided I would walk into the road/parking lot area to try and get a better look away from the trees. I asked our camp neighbor if he was seeing them as well. I pointed up and he said yes and took out his phone to record a video, but cell phones are just not powerful enough to see lights in the dark night sky. He said he couldn’t see it on his phone. He seemed much less impressed than myself about what we were seeing and went back to cleaning dishes.   Now here is where it gets interesting…As I followed the trail of traveling orbs I noticed that they did not follow the horizon and disappear as a satellite would. Rather, they travelled in a perfectly straight pathway out of the atmosphere, disappearing from sight as they got far enough away. It was something I had never seen before, like something you would see in a sci-fi movie.   There were 59 orbs traveling on the third perpendicular run. All in all 116 total orbs spotted by the naked eye. It by far the most unexplainable, bizarre, yet interesting thing I have ever seen. I would be interested to know if others saw what we saw that night.",

Glowing Oval Orb  I was originally taking a video of a bird and then rewatched the video and noticed a oval shaped orb in the sky. The object was first seen in the beginning of the video in front of my car and then I saw it again on the left side of my car. I zoomed in on the object and it had a very defined oval shape. It was very bright with a yellow glow and a small tint of green. It also had a outer glow outside the oval shape almost like a aura or haze. This was strange because because about a month ago I saw something similar except it was a night time and about a month prior I had a dream about an alien invasion... just odd.,
"Black, shape changing object, flies steady pace and altitude in Texas sky 2021  Ufo Texas, may 8, 2021 On May 8, 2021 at 3:27pm central time, I was a passenger in the back, passenger seat of a 4 door mini suv type vehicle with 2 other adult passengers (1 being the driver) and 1 child under 12. We were driving from Clear Lake Texas to the airport (I believe the Dallas Airport and can verify with adult passengers if needed). Admiring the vast blueTexas sky scattered with large fluffy, bright white clouds, looking out the passenger side window, I noticed a very small, singular, pitch black object, high in the sky. I watched for several seconds struggling to see what looked like an object flying/floating at a steady pace and altitude before remembering the capabilities of my Galaxy S21 Ultra smartphone camera. I pulled it out and turned it on immediately, after quietly and hesitantly asked aloud, ""is anyone else seeing what I'm seeing or am I trippin?"" I felt a little embarrassed to ask, thinking that maybe I was being foolish and just not calling to mind some very mundane thing I should have been able to readily identify. Because I was a passenger in a moving vehicle, unable to keep an eye on both the object and anything that would potentially block shots of the object in my video, AND the fact I had to zoom in at maximum capability, there are portions of the video where bridges and/or signs obstruct the view of the object. When zoomed out fully one can see how truly high in the sky the object was. On shots that are fully zoomed in the object can clearly be seen changing shape. At one point it even takes on a shape closely resebling the Eye of Horus, at another, a flying man. It almost looks like an incredibly large rope, of some sort, that keeps looping and twisting to take on some other form, but it feels like that would have to be an unbelievably thick rope to be witnessed from such distance, and it is unbelievable that any such thing could be light enough, in weight,, to be so high in the sky, let alone, to be keeping steady pace and altitude.

ufo in a storm cloud  just happened.  went to turn the water off in front yard.  dusk.  storm brewing west of Littleton.  look to the west above Ken Caryl and saw a bright light in the clouds.  stopped to watch as the light was just beneath the cloud.  Big thunderous cloud.  just then the light dove to the ground.  moved left right--stopped then to the ground.  in just moments..  awestruck.  waited.  maybe 2 minutes later saw the light rise lickity split and vanish into the thunderous cloud. went inside to crap my phone.  back out and recorded but nothing.  unreal.  ufo for sure.  massive rain and hail now happening.  hope someone else saw this. a ufo in a massive electrical storm for sure.,
"Lights over Northeastern AZ  At approx 20:05 on May 8 2021 in Concho, AZ, I was approaching my house after an evening walk, when I witnessed several white lights in the western sky moving northwardly. These lights appeared at a point or origin approximately 30 degrees above the horizon from my location. The lights made no sound, and moved at the same rate equidistant from each other. Approx 4 to five lights would appear, on after the other, all moving north in a straight line in succession before the first light or lead light would fade out abruptly, then another would appear at the point of origin. They appeared to move at an upward angle - not falling like a meteorite or aircraft flare. I witnessed no aircraft and the brightness was about equivalent to the evening stars in the sky. I went inside and grabbed my phone and told my wife to come outside. The lights were still appearing as we came outside the house and I pointed them out to my wife who confirmed what I saw. The lights conti! nued to appear for another 4 minutes before fading away altogether. During this sighting, the point of origin did not appear to move. I was able to capture about 2:55 min worth of video before the lights faded.   I was a witness to the Phoenix Lights many years ago and I remember how they seemed to hover in the air. These lights moved rapidly.",
"I was at frenchy's field park here in town. About 9 in the evening. I was hanging upside down from the pull up bar, doing my regular calisthenic exercises when I noticed the long single file caravan of non flashing white light spheres, traveling in a straight line heading North East. I lost count at about 30. There could have been a hundred in all. The line of these light spheres seemed to go from horizon to horizon almost. They were not low in the sky. Unknown distance but pretty high up. They were all single file, one in front of the other except for a single pair which were flying nearly side by side. Their speeds were not perfectly constant in relation to each other as they seemed to speed up/slow down. That's all i've got. I tried to film it but this video quality on my new phone is terrible and didn't pick any of it up. Surely there were other witnesses here in Santa Fe, I just hope they know to report it on this website.",
"3 lights, odd red color  Last night 5/8/21, driving home around 9:00 PM, a couple of minutes from my house, I saw three red lights in the sky.  They were a strange color of red, almost like a roadside flare color.  I followed out on to a dark country road.  Two of the lights disappeared. Then the last one disappeared.  Then it reappeared, then another, then all three  From my perspective, they were not in a line nor triangle and were at different altitudes.  I estimate below 3 thousand feet, the height normally helicopters are seen at.  The objects did not have any navigation lights and there was no sound. I tried to catch a movie.  I thought I was taking a movie and even zoomed in enough to see a hexagonal structure in the center.  It turns out I wasn’t recording.  Too much inexperience and adrenaline.  Anyway, I got home and sat in the driveway looking for them.  While watching after about 3-4 minutes, I see the starlink line transiting, moving towards the east.  I live just north! of Washington PA.  What I saw was not Starlink, but that is an odd coincidence.  Also, I worked for the USAF for 25 years and have seen many objects flying, but never one I couldn’t ID.  This morning, searching around the internet, I found a picture that most closely resembled what I saw.  I do so hope you have a report that discusses the same sighting.",
"I saw a row of 5 lights, round, each one the same size appear in the sky and slowly 1 by 1 faded away at the same point in the sky.  I saw a row of 5 white lights moving from southwest to northeast and slowly 1 by 1 faded away at the same point in the sky.",
string of lights roughly in line numbering more than 50 heading from roughly west then turning to the south  Noted a long string of lights roughly in line coming from the west and nearly over my house heading roughly south. Number of objects were more than 50. NO aircraft noises were heard. Too many for a squadron.,
"Dozens of lights moving in single-filed formation flying east  It was a clear sky and I looked out the window with my night vision to see stars and satellites more clearly.  Through the scope I noticed multiple lights moving in formation. I look with my eyes and there are what seem to be 50-100 lights flying in a single file formation headed east. I was completely shocked. It almost looked like auto tracer rounds fired in the sky but the lights kept going and these lights were moving along a horizontal plane. I was able to take a picture where you can see the lights moving. I tried filming through my night vision scope but only got about a seconds’ worth of seeing the objects. I was clearly fumbling because of my disbelief.  There were no sounds, no blinking lights, and no trails. They were moving very quickly up until I lost site of them because of a tree line blocking my view.",
"At 9:35 pm While setting outside I happen to look up in north west Direction and noticed a string of lights flying toward  the south west in a perfect line and evenly spaced and flying quietly I was able to have my family come out and we all where able to watch the event unfold, We stood in our drive way for at least 5 mins and watch the event there had to be at least 100 of the lights flying in this line the last one disappeared from view at 9:41 exactly. I would have to belive other people had to see this! there where other aircraft  in the sky at this time these things where not normal.",
"Fast Moving Spacecraft diving sideways then rising up.  On highway 5 coming back from L.A. to San Jose. My wife notice an object beside us in the sky about 500 yards from the highway . It was around 1:00am,the sky was black and out beside us was a reservoir of some kind .  At first I thought it was a remote control plane but then it was persistant and came closer getting bigger .That is when I realized that my wife was getting nervous as I was driving on the highway. We were all alone on the 5 .  I then looked really good and slowed down to about 40 mph from 85mph. The object was about the size of a car ,with lights;red,white,orange. It moved diving sideways down to the water of the reservoir fast ,very fast,then stopped and floated up slowly. It did this manuever about 6 times then came right beside the car and floated. Long enough to then get my attention really good.  That is when I observed a Metal object that I have never seen before in my life Moving in the night sky ,Diving sideways to the earth then floating up and reapeating this manuever several more time . Then in the blink of an eye disappearing in the sky.  It was not a plane or a remote control airplane. My wife was left very nervous and scared after the sighting. I admit that I was a bite nervous. After I noticed that we were the only ones on the highway .I got real nervous .  I never told anyone about this incident until know for reasons that are personal and will not be talked about.   It is hard to describe the shape because the craft looks different from other angles. I know that it was not that big, it had no windows that I could see, It had lights on the craft.    The ship was possitively some kind of Metal; silver in color ,with a dark black scraches.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date for the sighting.

"Verifiable sighting  Well, I was just about to fall asleep that night, when a light when a light went by my window.  I was curious, so I got up and went to my big, picture windows.  I saw a craft right flying very slowly just above my front yard.  I was speechless.    I followed it around the perimeter of my yard and then it hovered there for a second or two.  The craft was huge, with revolving, white lights on the bottom.  It was close enoough that I could see it was silver or gray in color.  It was also completely silent.    After it hovered for a second, it took off in the distance at an incredible speed.  It zigzag left, then right and then was gone.    My grandmother happened to live one house over from me and she called my mother in the morning telling her that she saw exactly what I saw.    Then on the radio that day they were joking about numerouos people calling into the station reporting that they saw a UFO.  It was no joke.   ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.

"Saw light moving erratically in the sky east of Ft. Carson training area  I was on gaurd duty in the Ft. Carson training area during the month of August during a Oklahoma NG summer rotation at about 0100 in the morning.Even though it was early in the morning I was alert for I was the only one on gaurd at the time in my platoon.As I was roving my area I noticed a light in the Eastern portion of the sky. It was I judge to be at least 10 miles away and to have about 1500-2000 ft. of altitude.The light was similar to that of an aircraft light and I watched it just to pass a little time.I probably would have lost interest but the light started to fly with erratic movement.It traveled to the south and as it did it would move ubruptly vertically down and then back up.At the distance I would say that these vertical movements were anywhere from 500-1000 ft.The light continued to do this for maybe 1 min. and then continued moving south until out of sight.There was no sound and the sky was clear and no other aircraft were in the sky at the time. I thought of awakening the other members of my platoon but, it was my first field excercise with them and I didnt think that they would believe me or appreciate being woken from their sleep.I am presently in the Reg Army and I have been since 1990. I have seen military aircraft and civilian and I have never seen anything out of the ordinary since then. When it starded moving funny I moved so that there was a small tree brach between field of vision and the light,at first I thought that it was me moving up and down and not the light but, using the limb as a referance I decided otherwise.I didnt have the hair stand up on my back or anything like that but it just seemed very odd.I would be happy to answer any questions pertaining to this event.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",
"it was about 110 clock at night when i saw this triangle ufo going over, it made no noise, but i could see indide of it  yes i saw the trinagle ufo only i saw inside the thing, it was full of people, there was this huge computer of some kind with all different colored lights and this white haired man was operatimg it, and other pilots were there in blue suits with white hair, the people were sitting in red velvet chairs, one fat lady was looking out the giant round windows, i never saw nothing like this thing and it did not make any noise as it flew away, i am not crazey i know what i saw, it matters not if anyone believes me",

"Out my back garden at advised time smoking a cigarette looking upwards as I always do at the night sky and stars looking for satellites and how many I can spot before I return inside.  All of a sudden to the east a massive light appeared to the east. It resembelled similar characteristics of what a meteor would display upon entering the atmosphere with an almost sudden flash and fast motion of light.  In complete shock and need to put a rational reason to whatbibwas seeing I stood in complete awe and disbelief as I witnessed the light intensify in what can only be described as an entry into the atmosphere then suddenly stop in it's tracks completely stsrtioery in it's position and gradually go from bright either that white so bright it blurred visually to gradually reducing in brightness intensity as it held it's position in the sky to the east and at a height I'd visually average to be lower than air traffic I have previously observed in the above area ... during this time I I went through all possibilities that could rationally and skeptically be the most fitting and probibal scientifical and environmental explanation pertaining to what I was seeing .. being a keen armature star gazer and astrology ( the necessary basics anyway) from a young age I considered and rules out any factors that underpin this .. ie Venus? Brightest in sky .. no it's moving .. plane /helicopter! or military aircraft that often travel overhead at these hours .. No noise.. completely will for about a minute no aircraft does this .. helicopter make noise.. meteor,  comet you name it I considered it .. all of these were not even close to fitting what i was witnessing before me and 100% certain in my observation that it was none if these.  In absolute excitement I shouted on my partner.. I mean he would never believe me if I told him.   And what an experience to miss out on even just visually .. on joining me he was also totally gobsmacked .. it's a ufo I exclaimed my partner.. who is thee biggest skeptic out .. agreed that what we were seeing was something totally crazy and unexplainable!! ..  After the light sat stationery for around no it's maybe minute and half it took off at rapid pace North East bound at a great rate .. also solidifying no aircraft made  by man has this ability .. it eventually went out of sight.  Since then there have been 2 occasions I have seen a busrt of bright flashing lights in sky at opposite sides of my home .. the have a short and delayed timing between bursts flash maximum 5 times and gone ... o have als9 witnessed what first appeared a satellite moving through night  sky then took an impossible and not characteristic of satellite 90 degree change in direction then fade or lost behind clouds... again I always rule out these man made explanations before I jump to an extraordinary conclusion",
"Fast streaking object in the sky with high-pitched whistling sound and NO contrails  One day I was waiting for my friend to finish helping his dad fix his gocart and I was just wondering in his neighbor's backyard out of boredom. Just then I heard the sound of a jet, but I listened more carfully and it sounded like a jet but with a high-pitched whistling sound with it. Then I finally saw it, it was streaking across the sky so fast that I knew ammediately that it couldn't be a jet. The weird thing was is that it had absolutely no contrails at all. But, even though this ordeal lasted around 5 minutes I didn't think about telling anybody else because I was so fascinated with it at the time.

"Aliens are friendly.  I was 16 , got up for drink and looked out kitchen window. White Ball of light huge floating in diagonal toward me and coming lower near hill in fron of my house . It stopped in mid air , and was close . I FELT it had seen me . I was frightened , ran to get parents , screaming ( they did not respond and garbled nonsense ) I was shouting to them GET UP THERES A SPACESHIP OUTSIDE "" They did not hear or get up at all. I ran back and FELT the spaceship was  speaking to  me inside my my head and told me not to be frightened .I was every frightened . Riveted to the floor with my mouth gaping open and just staring . Trying not to believe my own eyes , blinking them shut , opening them again  to check I was not mad . I still screamed out for my parents and they did not come . Then the fear I gave up , and words of YOUR SPECIAL _ DONT BE FRIGHTEND boomed in my mind . It came from the spaceship and I felt energy and calmness all of a sudden .  I asked them to tell me they knew I was talking back and to move the craft when I said so . It did . It did a triangle for me , and then again . It wa so bright and I felt strange . I found myself later in my kitchen at Dawn , sun coming up. I waited by the radio for BIG WORLD NEWS that never came , became withdrawn  and concerned  for myself all by myself for a few weeks that no one else was coming forward . My parents  asked me what the hell I was screaming at them for to get up and confirmed they remembered  something I said about a UFO . My parents under any other circumstances would have whooped by butt and got right up out of bed  for yelling as hard as I was , so I beleieve they were knocked out by something. Greymouth where I saw this , is 13 miles direct south east  of Kaikoura , where I learned 15 years later  while watching a TV show of the white flying objects seen by AIr New Zealand near there.  Famous video footage I believe . I knew  the  that I  had seen the same craft and much closer than they did , in the same dates, but I also had them talking to me for ! years to shut up so I did that , and still feel strange doing so  . They took me away it seems becuase I lost all these morning hours . . I saw more people inside ( approx 20 ) all lined up behind and infront of me , we had to take showers that didnt use water . They said they were us from the future ,historians  trying to learn from the past. It changed my life forever , and I still cry if no one I ever tell this story to is willing to accept my truth or believes me. It is so fraustrating . I am 37 now.  Aliens to me are not scary , and shouldnt be to anyone else .  Teachers , timetravellers or messengers , the ones who talked to me when I was sixteen feel sad  that we are such cavemen especially in our attitudes of all things on Earth ( for example they said - when we mine the gold , quartz , coal , oil , crystals etc  removing and displacing resources  from their natural habitat to all parts of the globe , we are  denaturalising the  skin of the planet . We have wrecked the weather and  many  important magnetic fields doing this ). Aliens as we so call them , also observe us as animals as we are so unclean , full of disease and boast rather  digusting habits , sport loose dangerous ideas, politics and morals . They believe we disrespect too many other creatures that we live with to prove their point, and that we are not every smart, even the greatest of scientists on earth .  They believe we are too primitive and immature as an evolutionary race right now to communicate  with and that we could not handle the truth  about ourselves at this time . They feel happy to share with humans and will gladly teach them things if they are willing to be taught .  They also believe we  can all understand the bible and the analogy of Jesus life as nothing more than the best description of ""Love "" and alot of "" how to live and think on the planet Earth "" ever written by  human beings  probably touched by the same truth ,and the same light. It may be considered wild  by some that Id say all this , but its got to be said ust to get it off my cheast after all these years . Id know there are others out there who have had the same meetings as I have . I have read some of their books and learned that others have heard the voice of an alien as well . Just not all of them actually got to see the source of its projection first . f anyone has , Id be happy to know your there .",
"We got lost in our motor home north of Calico, Nevada, about midnight. We wandered about for a couple of hours then shut down for the night about 2 am. After we had watched the stars for a half hour we noticed we were near(4 miles +-) an active airbase. Suddenly a group of very fast lights dropped over the base and began to zip around the airbase. Suddenly a large yellow globe descended and hovered over the airbase. A small globe came out of the large globe (it kept hovering) and descended to what appeared to be the main base. The other lights kept zipping about the airbase and the large globe kept hovering. After about 30 mins the small globe ascended up to the large glove and disappeared inside. They shot off into the firmament. Followed by the other skipping lights. It all appeared routine and after they left things continued on as before. We do not know where we were, somewhere in northern Nevada and in the morning we found our way back to the hyway and proceeded to Vegas.  None of us use drugs nor were any of us drinking, we were just lost.  We never told anyone then because they would have said we were all crazy.

"P-3 Orion Encounter  We were on an exercise one night tracking an American Sub, when our In-Flight Technician (IFT) called the cockpit (Flight) reporting ""traffic 9 o'clock Parallel,"" to which FLIGHT told him to ""keep an eye on it.""  We all found out later that our IFT was reporting what he thought was a starboard side navigational light (green) from another aircraft heading the same direction as ourselves.   A few minutes later, the IFT keyed the mic and was gonna suggest that FLIGHT change course as the Green light appeared to be getting closer, but he really got out was ""Holy (expletive)!!!  What the hell is that thing?  Flight, you guys see it?"".  All this sudden commotion on the intercom got me and the other Acoustic operator to look up from our stations.  Looking up the ""tube"" (which we affectionately called the aircraft interior), we saw the flight station was flooded with a brilliant light shining through every window from above.  I got up from our station and made my way up the Tube towards the cockpit.  Both pilots and the flight engineer (FE) were leaning forward trying to look up.  Everybody was kind of panicky and yelling back and forth in the flight station when the brilliant light stopped, and the pilot said ""look at that! look at that!!.""  The object had moved from above us to about a hundred yards off of our port wing.  That was the first I actually got to get a look at it.  It was about 50 feet long, cylindrical, and green light all over.  The surface was smooth, or at least I couldn't make out any markings or features.  The second FE came up to the flight station with this high tech camera that we used for intel gathering.  He told me to move, so he could get some good shots of it.  I made my way aft to the port overwing exit so i could see the object.  It just stayed off our wing for maybe 2 or 3 minutes then shot off and up faster than anything I have ever seen.  It went from about 100 yards to out of sight in just a couple seconds.  Our Navigator/Communications officer (NAVCOM or NAV) had been on the radio with Red Crown (An AEGIS Cruiser acting as the air traffic control for the exercise area) who asked that we loiter on station and see if we could re-establish contact.  We remained on station for another half hour and were told to RTB (return to base).   When we landed, two white government vans took all of us to the briefing/debriefing center.  We were interviewed one at a time.  Our interviews taped.  Our film confiscated... (two of the guys had their own personal cameras and had snapped some photos too).  Our mission tapes confiscated.  We were told to not discuss this flight and made to sign an agreement to that effect.   Well, we thought this was all too cool, so we get back to the barracks and my buddy, who had been the radar operator on the flight, and myself started spilling our guts.  ""We saw a freakin UFO!!!""  The following day, our crew was called into the CO's office, he informed us that he was hearing ""stories"" and reiterated the fact that we were ""NOT to discuss it.""  So with the exception of a few hushed story swappings, here and there... we did.

"While staying at a friends three UFOs were seen in the night sky  The first we both saw was a large object in the sky. It looked to be 1/3rd the size of the moon or larger (also thought it was pretty high up, which stayed stationary for at least 10 minutes until our attention went back to focusing on other things. The second we saw was a light blue ball light that did a "" /\/ "" (zig-zag) pattern and dissappeared, this was seen est. 300 yards and 100 ft. off the ground. The third looked almost like a sattelite orbiting earth, but was not moving in a straight line but changing directions repeatedly, which we didn't look at more than 4 minutes. UFOs were not all that were seen that night, but more then you (in my opinion) would understand or know (including me). PS. I have seen another UFO with a similar (yellow-orange) "" /\/ "" pattern while sitting on a porch swing at my house. It too dissapeared as if a light switch were switched off.",
"I was posting gaurd watching the perimeter when i looked up and saw what was to be a shooting star.  So I quickly turned on my ANPVS7 (night vision) and looked up.  It was going in a straight line but then all of a sudden it was going up and down and in circles then faided out.  I know I must of been tired but light is amplified through night vision so I know what I saw, and it wasn't military.  Just on guard the back groung seemed a little haunting. I asked my friend if he had seen it and he said no.  He came up to me ten minutes later just to tell me that he felt weird being around this area.  I didn't blame him I felt it to.  The thing that I saw in the sky was way to far anyway to have that kind of affect on us.",

The Craft traveled from over Sun Valley area to the vicinity of the Then Reno Cannon International Airport as fast as I could turn my head from left to right.  This craft passed Approx. 100 yards in front of me traveling  in A north to south direction out over the airport.  As the craft came into close proximity to me I could see that it was A silverish color and was reflecting the ambiant light in the area from the buildings and surrounding lights.  There were lights around the base of the craft which moved in A clockwise direction.  The lights were elongated and oval shaped and I noticed that everytime the lights oscilated it was A differant color.  I have never seen lights like this anywhere before the clairity and crispness are beyond description.  The craft was close enough to the ground that when it went behind the , then MGM Grand Hotel it was Half way between the top of the building and the ground.  There was no sound, I experianced no electrical or engine problems when this craft passed in proximity.  Once past the MGM it took A steep upward course and disappeard out of sight.  I have written Art Bell about this Incident A couple of times and have even drawn A picture of what the craft looked like but I have never recieved A response from Art in reguards to this incident.  I know this is  A cold case but I just found out about your reporting site.  I am A retired Police Officer of 23 years and I have seen alot of unusual things in my time , but never have I seen anything like this.  Oh I have seen numerous zig zagging lights on clear summer nights while on patrol but nothing came even close to this craft.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",
"I did not see any kind of space craft!, but I did see a very bright slash of light exactly in the shape of diagonal line (like the trail of a jet, but this one was far too low in the sky and it was not like any sort of light that I had seen before....but I'm positive that it was not any sort of natural phenomenon...atleast did not look like one?     Anyway, I just thought I'd share this information...as this happened on my way back from houston to Oklahoma state university in Stillwater where I used to study.  What I saw looked like some really small(almost the size of a car/slightly bigger...but it was really close to the road and looked like whatever it was it was heading up from almost 25/30feet of the ground and left a short tail of bright white light behind which looked like a fast flash of a very bright laser light in the middle of the nowhere as that stretch of the highway had no lighting and had small dunes on the left and right and no shops or anysort of activities happening at that time though I have seen some workers around that area during the day some times with a lot of trucks and digging machines.  Nothing got to do with the light but just thought the information would help.  I did not stop my car when I saw the light but I did slow down as I got a sudden fright looking at the light, as it was so out of the blue.",
"At about 3 AM I saw a light heading toward me which had no other navigation lights. It droopped a cylinder obliquily and turned upward  I was cruising in the Bahamas and saw a single light come toward me from the North. I was on a North - South line about 3 miles off of the Northern Exumas. It kept coming toward me with only one light which I perceived to be a landing light. However, It had a beam go down at a slanted diirection and then something went down the beam after which the light went upwards and disappeared. I, being an old pilot ,thought it was a drug drop but I could not account for the slanted beam and the object which seemed to defy gravity. There was only one light and no noise.",
Driving east on 303 looked left and seen a big orange ball and then a circle of colored lights flying directly towards it pulled over to take picture and the colored likes came back at us took off real fast got scared.

"I saw  glowing orange oval stationery craft on an island at night  there was one oval ,glowing orange craft sitting on a small uninhabited island(Pinel),I was looking at it from my house on a hill,1km. away ,it was very dark(3 am)and the ufo wasn`t moving,I didn`t know what it was and I was looking at it trying to figure out what is it,then I said to myself;oh they came,and I scared myself and run to my friend`s room,what woke me up was a sound of a cooper plate(that was hanging on the cement wall)hitting the wall(electromagnetism?),at first I thought it was the tradewind putting it in motion,before I saw it I didn`t belive in ufo`s...I spoke with some friens about it ,they said that other people camping there saw it also at different dates,",
"hugh wing shaped object  It was shaped like a flying wing. The windows of the fuslage emitted white light.  Half way down the wings there were twomore white lights as well as white lights at the end of the wing tips.  The object made a weird oscilating sound and moved very slow.  This is what drew our attention to it.  I estamate it was between 4 to 500 feet above the ground.  Looking  straight up and out the upstairs window We could just see the end of the wing tip.  The fuslage was about 500 ft. or more from that wing tip, and out over the tops of the trees in the back field.  The trees are about 300 ft. from the back of the house. The other end or wing tip was almost out of sight.   It had to be 1000 to 1200 ft. in length from wing tip to wing tip. It moved extremily slow and went in a striaght line.  It finally dissappeared from sight behind the tree line at the far end of the upper part of the field.  The sound was still audible for awhile until it faded.  ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested further information from the witness regarding a more accurate date of the incident.  PD))",
"Triangular lights floating along a tree line in a cow pasture, no noise. North Carolina.  I fell asleep on the couch downstairs. Woke up at around three to realize that I should go upstairs to bed. I walked to the bathroom with no light (because i know my house and where to walk.) There's a window on my left overlooking the the cow pasture with a small creek and tree's following it. I look above the tree line and there's a object hovering along the tree line about fifty yards away. At first I thought it was a helicopter. I opened the window and listened. No sound. After a few moments of trying to figure it out, I got this really scared feeling of ""oh shit, I think I know what that is."". I then pissed all over the whole bathroom and ran upstairs to wake my parents. But what the hell are they supposed think, A 15 year old kid runs upstairs screaming there's something outside. So they tell me to get in bed but weren't really awake enough to comprihend what i was saying. I got in the bed thinking at least they wont take up alone. 5 to ten minutes later, two ground rattling sounds came flying over the house. I thought this was it. I later put two and two together and figured that it had to be fighter jets coming to investigate. It had to be because no airport near my house was capable of harboring a plane of that magnitude. I laid in that bed till Moring awake, scared ((deleted)). Three years later my father finally saw it too…",
"I was on a routine patrol on a state highway in Massachussets, (ironically only a few miles from my home).  It was about 3 am in the morning and I was heading north bound when I observed approximately a dozen seperate lights on the initial horizon.  There were about six of these ""lights"" in ""opposition"" to each other approaching the others at a very rapid pace.  My first impression was that these ""lights"" could be searchlights operating from two seperate directions but in synchronization to each other. It suddenly occured to me that no power on earth could synchronize these lights at the speed and directional changes they were operating at.  At this point I was so taken aback I actually ran my cruiser off the roadway.  I took the next exit (my home) and parked the cruiser in my yard - we lived on a 90 acre stretch so it was isolated.  About five minutes later I looked up at the sky and saw an enormous, oval shaped object flying approximately 300-400 feet in the air in a westward direction - due to the darkness, the altitude was an approximation.  This object approached my direction.  I stood in the roadway attempting to interpret what I was observing - the craft made no loud noise but rather as it passed overhead I could only describe it as a ""whoosing sound"" - very quiet.  At certain intervals  there seemed to be a circular, revolving series of low impact lights surrounding the craft which was moving rather slowly to the west.  I went into my home to wake my wife but she was too frightened to step outside.  Rather than reporting the incident I tried to call Otis Air Force Base but the lines were jammed, as were those of a local police department - as discretion is often the better part of valor I put the incident in my own ""I don't know file"" and just let it be.   ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is unknown to us, at this writing.  We will attempt to obtain the date from the witness, who describes self as a public employee of the State of Massachusetts.  PD))",
"Me and my boyfriend were driving and I noticed a bright light reflecting on the river.  It continues to follow us for 6 miles down the highway and we turned off into a county road and parked and it stopped, as well.  It was very visible.  It was hovering above a pine tree for over 3 hours, and moved up to the sky and stayed visible until the sun was up.    During the 3 to 4 hours we watched this object, we noticed about 10 nsa drones watching and making direct passes to it.  There were approx 8 other ufo way dimmer in light flying around the night sky changing in brightness and making noises that were unfamiliar.  This was the most life changing experiences I've ever had.  It was unbelievable.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD))",
Sitting at the park at night seem the disc going over the tree tops 30mph.  Then the disc shot up in to the space in one sec.  NO SOUND.  50feet wide.  I saw a light two consecutive night for an hour each night.  Second night light flew infront of the car startled I pulled away from the light and it started to muve away as soon as i was afraid.  Also on the second night a black suburban pulled in the parking area towards the woods away from me and the light.  The vehicle had no tags and appeared to be watching me with the light. The Globe was close to 40ft. round.  no sound.  I asked where are you from and it shot up to space and back down.  no sound.  It was like no other thing I had ever seen.  Then in 1998 I saw two globes of light flow over the hill in formation and flew behind some trees.   11/99  my self and a friend saw a triangle of light flew over our heads and over the trees on TVA PROPERTY...3miles past K-25 nuclear plant.  ??/99  Have bad ass video of a light flying over same property.  will take polygraph..,
"It appeared out of nowhere, and then silently took off and formed a tracer  My dad turned 50 and had rented Folkets Hus in Örviken outside Skellefteå, where they live, and we had a huge party. I was sort of ""personel"" on this party so I kept sober and when the guests had left me, my family, my mothers parents and the band consisting of her colleagues (teachers on Ursviksskolan) stayed. I was carrying boxes of dishes back to the car, when I noticed the band smoking by their van. I joined them and smoked a cigarette and as we stood watching the clear star sky we saw ISS fly by. A band member, I can't remember which, made a joke about it being ""the mothership"". As soon as he said that... Ok, I need to describe how this place looks. It's ""Folkets Hus"" in Örviken, and it's in a small peninsula with a single road. If you walk out the house you go to a parking lot with the road to your left, and coast to your right, and on the other side of the road there's a patch of forest and beyond that sea. To your left is a coast with the same sea. Anyways, when that was said a single blue circle lit up just above the treeline across the street. We all fell quiet, and just watched this thing hang there in complete silence. I didn't have a smartphone but when the initial shock calmed down I realized I should take a picture and reached for my phone. I tried my code a couple of times without taking my eyes of this thing, and when I noticed it lit up this thing took off and flew above us so fast it left a light-tracer on the sky, and disappeared beyond the horizon behind me without making a single sound in less than a second. It was there, then I saw a flash, then it was gone. If noone else had reacted I'd suspected a micro psychosis, but we all saw it.  I know it's late, but I just found out about you and I want to get my witness out somehow. Because I haven't been able to stop thinking about it ever since. It was me, my dad, and 5 teachers who saw it. I was 20 at the time.  The time is a bit hazy I'll admit, but when you see something so unbelievable time sort of stops meaning something. You get caught up in it. I didn't believe in UFOs before this what so ever, and the event shattered my 20 year old reality at the time. I'm 35 today and I still can't stop thinking about it.",
"I want to know if anyone has had a like experience.   About 3:45AM one morning I was awakened to a noise coming from my three-year-old son's room.  Eventhough there was a rain and electrical storm outside I could hear this noise, like a clicking sound with some occasional high-pitched  gurgling.  Concerned that my son might be having some breathing problems I sat up in bed and directed my attention to the hallway where his door was.  It startled me that his door was closed, as we had never closed his door in the past.  Again I heard the noise and even though I tried for a brief moment to wake my wife I could not rouse her.  Again and again I heard the noise and was quite terrified that someone possibly was in my son's room.  I quickly gathered my courage and went to my closet for my S&W 45 caliber semi-automatic pistol.  I chambered a round and moved to my son's door putting my ear against the door.  Again I heard the sounds and burst into the room.  What I saw next will never leave me... something I think about several times every day since then.  The way my son's room was laid out was my son's little bed was to the left of the open door and a window was directly ahead.  Eventhough the light was off, a moment after I burst in I looked directly into my son's bed as lightening illuminated the room. I could see my son setting up in bed facing a small alien creature as if they were playing or something.  Simultaneously I realized the window was open, the screen was off and there was a larger alien creature somehow hovering just outside the window.  The rain was pouring into the open window and I have learned since then that the best way I could describe the creature is that it was a ""Grey"".  I was petrified and could not move.  I could tell by it's movements that I startled the alien outside the window as much as it startled me.  The next thing I know, I am laying on the floor looking up at the lightening painting the ceiling and realized that my entire backside is soaking wet, the window open, it was not raining and my son was sound asleep in his little bed. ! Later I found my 45 laying in the center of the dinning room table with the magazine removed and one bullet (the chambered round) missing.  I have not been able to reconcile this event to this date.  The window was certainly open, the screen on the ground two floors below (we lived on the second floor) and the carpet was soaked.  In addition, the missing bullet was never found.  I don't know how long I was out or why I was out but it could not have been more that a couple hours.  I know this was a Grey who, for some reason, was letting it's child play with mine.  I will never be the same.  Before this I thought folks who saw UFOs were quacks.  ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates no date for the event, and elects to remain totally anonymous.

"Coming home, saw triangular object about 60' from house.  Coming home, heard faint humming,  like a transformer, looked around and saw large triangular object about 60' away and about 40' high hoovering.   It was already there when it was noticed.  It was flat black, and had 4 round golden white lights, one at each tip and one in the center.  It moved behind house, to the North.    Went into house to set packages down and when returned it was gone. (Fulton:Callaway County)   Uploaded to database by investigator.",
stbound on I80 just starting up pequop pass when a small cluster of stars caught my eye. one above the other and below to the east another as i was looking at them the bottom one {the one to the east} dimmed out to black. I thought that was strange and continued up the pass about two minutes after I looked up at them again and the light streaked up at about a 2oclock position and lit up as it streaked upwards..It looked like a shooting star but going upwards..I thought it was strange because it dimmed out before it lit up and took off... thank you for your importaint work...,
"I was talking with a friend outside her building when a plane passed over head. I looked up and about 1 in. (arm extended) to the left (north) of the plane I saw what seemed to be a star moving across the sky. It began to pulsate on and off after alerting my friend to what I saw. It continued to do this as it crossed the sky, eventually going out of sight.  The light seemed to be a star. It was traveling from West to East. It began to pulsate on and off repeatedly. No Sound. Cloudless sky. Proceeded to pulsate until out of sight. I am a computer operator for a legal firm and the other witness is a receptionist for the Transit Authority.",
White star like dot moving across sky before day light.  06/27/2021 at 4:47am while looking up at the sky a very small white dot moved faster than a plane from northwest to southwest. It was moving in a straight line.,

"Massive black triangle with curve corners, a red, yellowish, and blue round set of lights under each side hovering overhead  It was dark and I turned on our garage light. As I walked down back stairs to our driveway, I heard a low but deep sound. When I reached the driveway, I looked up and right above my head was a massive black triangle that also extended past our ranch home and just above our roof. There were A set of red, blue and yellowish round lights underneath each side. Since it was dark out and the craft was black, I believe I was only able to see it because of the lights underneath it and being underneath it as well. They were not blinding, so I could see the entire shape of the craft which hovered over and then very very slowly moved completely over roof then gone in seconds. I watched it for a good 2 1/2 to 3 minutes at most I’d say. Needless to say I was in awe. I am a 66 year old wife, mother and grandmother. I decided to find where to report, since I’ve been unable to get a full nights sleep since the encounter-not through fear but the unbelievable experience I was lucky enough to have.",
"3 odd lights one 1 very large craft moving in a way aircraft do not.  My husband was out feeding our bottle calf Moomoo when he called me on my cell and said to grab my coat and come look at something quick. I went out and saw a craft that was too large and flying too low and moving in a manner in a way that aircraft do not. It had 3 lights along it the one In the center was steady while the other two blinked, the craft moved slowly and seemed to be rotating as it went. As it moved the center light began to blink as well. It had an aura or outline and you could see it was one large craft not 3 separate ones. We have aircraft that fly over from our small local airport often so we are well acquainted with what they look like at all times of day. This was not normal. As it moved dogs in the areas it moved over began to bark. Also a normal aircraft was in the sky as well and was very clearly different. We watched for several minutes and I went inside.",
Massive craft with 3 flashing lights flying slowly SE. Lights eventually just stopped flashing. Way too slow and large to be a plane. Occasionally military cargo planes fly in our area and this was much larger. It was headed in the general direction of the yakima firing center and Hanford.

"Driving home over the Narrows Bridge and saw three bright lights hovering that seemed to be connected.  We were driving over the Narrows Bridge from Tacoma to Gig Harbor. I looked to the North and noticed high above the power lines that go across the straight there were these three really bright lights. They were moving slowly or hovering and faintly looked like they were connected in a large v shape. There is an airport in Gig Harbor and I know that sometimes airplanes line up in their flight pattern can look like that from far away, but these lights were obviously the same height and distance. Also, airplanes are never flying in the proximity of the electrical wires. They were not moving fast like an airplane and were far enough apart that they were not wing lights on one plane. Whatever it was, was pretty big. Super weird! We only had a minute or so to observe the lights before our view was cut off. The only logical explanation that I can think of is that they were military helicopters hovering in a formation with spotlights on.",
Color changing lights slowly approaching  At approximately 9:21 p.m. my girlfriend and myself went to take out the garbage. The sun was set but it was still a little daylight. She noticed what she thought was a bright colorful star. After watching it for a while she went inside and I continued to watch. As I watched I realized that this object was a lot smaller than what it appeared to be the closer it came the dimmer the light got. Out of my peripheral I noticed another smaller object to this objects left approaching in the same manner. Then there was a larger one that displayed the most beautiful brightest colors that never left it's location in the sky. It kind of just bobbed around up there. The others slowly in a floating manner proceeded to the water tower. In about an hour there was at least 5 orb like objects hovering over and around the water tower. They were mostly silent other than random high-pitched yips here and there. The neighboring dogs were going crazy barking at them.Their lights would dim out at approaching vehicles. They looked to be analyzing/ searching the water tower. They have been back The past 3 nights same time same location.,
"Bright Orange light over Johnsonville/Cameron area.  9:45pm on March 9th, 2022. Bright orange object moving across sky at extreme high speed, sharp angle turns and sudden stop. No sound.

We saw the actual ufo after she spotted a light and caught it on video.  My fiancée texted me that she saw something abnormal. It was about 11:30 pm on March 9th 2020. I asked for a video . She sent one of a light that wasn’t the moon just sitting in the sky. The moon was covered in clouds tonight so it was dimmer than what this light was. I went out and I looked around. A lot. After about 20 minutes I noticed something weird in the sky. I looked near the town of Haysville near me and saw 2 Teardrop UFO. They were very oddly lit but I couldn’t get a clear image of them due to it being dark. But when a loud sound boomed the sky my horses started running in fear.,
"While driving home on highway, saw two large square crafts blinking red and green.  Hi there, While driving home to Nanaimo from Duncan at around 10 pm I saw two large square crafts that were blinking red and green. I was very shocked as I had just seen the same thing the previous night, however this time the first one I saw was much closer over the highway so I could definitely tell this time it was very very large , square and blinking red and green. Yesterday when I saw the same thing while at home on my deck , it was very far away so I chalked it up to maybe being a special type of plane or some new technology that the government uses. This time I was so shocked I saw it again, I phoned my husband on speaker phone while I was driving to tell him what I was seeing. The craft was flying back and fourth over the highway. It then stopped in place , I could not find anywhere safe to pull over to take a picture or video as this highway is along the ocean. As I drove by that one and it disappeared farther up the highway by Ladysmith there was another large square craft that looked the same , blinking red and green. It almost scared me because I did not see the one from farther up fly to this spot. So I think it must have been another one. The highway wasn’t very busy at this time of night but the few cars on the highway looked like they slowed down as well to take a look. I probably wouldn’t have reported this if I didn’t see the crafts both nights. Thank you.",

"Seen two sphere shaped objects in the sky that definitely weren’t a plane, jet or helicopter. This is the third time we have seen this.  I emailed back on February 11, 2022 about witnessing an odd sphere shaped object in the sky for a second time that came from the same direction and went the same direction both times and both times the duration of seeing it go across the sky was 5 minutes. Now today March 10, 2022 at 8:06 A.M. I was outside with my two children waiting for their school bus when we noticed the same sphere shaped object coming towards our direction but this time there was another sphere shaped object behind it kind of like making a hovering movement. The second one even disappears and reappears in the sky twice. Both sphere shaped objects even have like a haze around them. This time we even noticed at one point when it was coming closer to our direction of where we were standing in our driveway that the first sphere shaped object had blue lights around it like in a circle. Both sphere shaped objects went in the same direction and the duration of seeing both in the sky lasted for 5 minutes like the first two sightings. Out of the 13 years that I have lived in this area I have never seen anything like this until that first sighting on October 14, 2021 at 6:09 P. M. and then the second sighting on February 11,2022 at 8:05 A.M. We have airplanes, helicopters and jets fly quite a bit over our direction so I have seen what those look like in the sky and what we have seen those three times is definitely not airplanes, helicopters or jets. All three sightings my two children were outside with me at our house and just like me are very curious as to what this is that we have seen now three times within 5 months.",
"Little bit about myself. I never used to believe in ufo. I have a degree in mechanical engineering and and can provide certification for authentication of my studies and qualifications, but in my life of 38 years I have never seen anything like this it didn't make any sound at all not even the sound of air being pushed out of its way as it flew over my house ,it was quite, very quiet and i focused my attention but no sound just like a helium balloon, but this Matte Silver Sphere was moving fast i know this because there is a flight path for passenger aircraft right above my property and I know how they fly over, I have lived here for 12 years and often spend time at the backyard so I'm very familiar with the different aircraft that may fly over but this Sphere was at least twice the height of the planes regular flight path of the passenger Planes but three times faster with NO WINGS, NO PROPELLER, NO SOUND and NO Duct or Jets it was plain and sleek but somewhat still a round Sphere shaped, it went straight like it was on an invisible track like it was being pulled by a force rather then propelling towards it, and it also didn't generate low pressure or higher pressure areas because there was no disturbance in the atmosphere behind the Sphere shaped flying object but it was going fast it should have made a sound or something im no scientist or a tripper i witnessed this thanks to a friend whom pointed it out, I googled the sphere and after seeing the exact same thing that the pentagon confirmed a ufo I thought if ld raise my voice because people don't understand the true severity of it and can't accept it anyway hope this helps someone or something but no bull I actually seen a ufo I believe there is technology we don't even known of yet as public..",
"Cloudlike spherical object with no real form but hard edges appeared and held a position at altitude despite winds aloft then vanished  Something that looked akin to a giant clear ballon but more oblong/spherical shaped showed up in the sky on a relatively clear day. It had a cloudy appearance, almost, it's hard to describe, but it wasn't a cloud and it's shape was ""active"" though not really changing. It made no sense. It was planted at a point in the sky and clouds were passing it, then it simply vanished. I didn't think it was a UAP until I saw pictures that navy pilots took off the coast (within a few miles of this exact spot) and one of them looked exactly like this.

"UFOs I witnessed  First off I would like to make clear, the reason for today's date as a sighting date is because I've witnessed 3 UFOs at 3 times in my life. I came across this website by happenstance as I was looking at 1970s photos of new jersey etc. What I first witnessed was seen by 7 of us in the summer of 1984 or 85. I lived in a mobile home community(Cedar Crest) in Vineland New Jersey.It was 10'oclock at night and a bunch of us just got done playing team Frisbee. We all saw a low flying black object with an illuminated windshield where you could make out the sillouttes of beings inside( chest up to heads) and it glided so slowly and projected colored light to the ground red,green,blue and would fade to each .The 2 people who were with us were in their 40s and parents to the 1 girl and he (father) said it was a blimp. I'm 19 at the time and my future husband both said it can't be. Its not advertising anything and the shape was a pointed front end that both sides went back to form a flat end. A trapezoid if you will.When it got close we all waved hello and watched it slowly go over and kept going south until covered by tree line. I will never forget it. The 2nd sighting was where I live now. August 29,2018 3:23 am, my dog woke me to go out. Windows were open and I heard what sounded like a helicopter in the distance.I rolled over and back to sleep. 20 mns later my dog woke me to go as now he meant business. I got up and went to the bathroom and heard the same him as prior. I went to the window and saw a stationary bell shaped craft just sitting g in the eastern sky.I put Geddy on his leash and went outside. I noted the time as 3:25 am as flip phone in pocket indicated( unfortunately no camera on my primitive phone.it had lights on either side. The left side the lights flowed up and down the right side they stayed on. It had a distinct hum of an idoling engine. I watched for 23 minutes. Then it slowly went up on an angle to the north. Stopped and stayed there for 5mns and then back the way it came but kept going. I called news/ police stations if anyone reported anything. I checked media for the next week. Nothing. Third sighting was October 2019. It was close to sunset and I was walking south with my dog along the farm field. The sky was clear and blue. As I was looking this football shaped nickel colored craft popped in from out of nowhere. It stayed for 1 second and skipped like a rock across water to the right horizontally. I have shared my UFO experiences. Thank you.",
It was way higher than the plane  s it was shaping but could tell it turns mostly into a flat object realesing some type of blurry arrow around it. It was hard yo sea but material was black and done red details in top only could see when the object shaped or moved.

"Large bright circular object slowly cruising at low heights around Mount Union PA  Me and another saw lights then a large U.F.O. in the sky! There are multiple videos taken by several people! Even on Facebook! We have evidence!!!! This is serious. Then, later on, I seen the some type of object farther out in the sky. With the bright lights. They were red and white/yellow exactly. Then all the lights besides a red light turned off mid flight. It was also very loud when it got close.",
Flying saucer in the sky  Me and my sister were driving home around 7:20 pm and looked up in the sky and noticed 4 bright lights in a straight line and we took a video and zoomed in and the object was a saucer.,
"Cone shaped thing over the ocean  I was on my balcony looking at the ocean and saw a cone shaped thing with a weird flight pattern flying. It was just too straight. Thought I was seeing a plane wrong, but the more I watched it was cone shaped and the green light that it was emitting was like a beam and it wasn’t a star. I finally said out loud (but didn’t yell) “hi, can you hear me?” And the green light went out and I never saw it again. I recently saw a coastal news article with a lady’s picture from 2014 and it looked exactly like one of those cone shaped things in her picture over the pier. That’s how I found this site.",

"i went into garden and it was there  i somehow was awoken at about 11.15pm,i sat on the edge of bed, I was like instructed to go down stairs and out of my back door.(there was something not quite right about this it seemed like it was my own free will but something is niggling me that it wasn't.)i then was in my garden i looked in front of me and about 10 feet away and ruffly 15foot high there was this round object ,i immediately said to myself Jesus it's a ufo drone .i looked at it for about 3 minutes. I then just casually turned around and went back to bed. The object was not making any sound, there was no visible exhaust ,also the trees very close to it were not moveing.it was white except for a slight patch on the right hand flank which was of a rust couler as daft as it sounds the drone was made to look like the moon.(the moon was actually high in the sky and to the left on this evening)oh it was about 10 to fifteen foot across in the morning i arose jumped up and went to see if there was any evidence ,but non that i could see. I also realized that not only did i not take a picture or throw something at it i realized that it simply was not a option to do. now this next bit is very strange. About a week later i woke up thinking that i had had some people about 3 maybe 4 around me while asleep.as i sat there i felt a itch on my belly i lifted up my shirt and there was a fresh wound. about 1and a half inches across and 3q of a inch wide. Not sure how deep. I thought what the hell. I no i went to bed without it .a few weeks later i was at my doctors ,while there i asked the doc what she thought it was, she said that is a three degree burn, I told her story and she said that this burn would have been so painful you would have woken up.so you must have somehow been made unable to feel it.there is a scar .i believe that Thay are both connected .my background.

"Enormously bright white light flew over my truck and disappeared  I was driving southbound on interstate 95 near mile marker 110 near Doswell Virginia. Something caught my eye in my peripheral on the right side. I saw a large white light that was brighter than any light I've seen, it flew from the passenger side over my truck and went South but disappeared within one second. It disappeared before any type of tree line or horizon. It looked like it was about 100 feet above my semi. It traveled faster than anything I've ever seen in the sky. It was just a white very bright circular light.",

Has happened every night for three years.  I have been watching this craft break off into three separate crafts for 3 yrs. Always bright changing colors. I have up close pictures and far away pictures. Always 3am to sunrise and always N.E. to N.W. got to a point of it moving up into a much bigger craft.,
"It was 2 parallel glowing lights.  The glowing lights were exactly parallel and seemed to hover. There was a plane taking off from the airport and it was very very small compared to these lights. The plane disappeared into the atmosphere but the lights stayed. I turned my head for several seconds and thy were gone. They weren’t climbing in elevation like the plane so I was very very surprised when they were suddenly gone . I second guessed myself and what I had seen, so I didn’t report until now. I have been studying UFO sightings since that day and am now 100 % sure that is what I saw. It was unbelievable.",
"The object was fairly high in the sky and it remained stationary or would move horizontally, sometimes slow, sometimes fast.  At about 5:25am on 3/11/2022 I got out of bed to get a glass of water. Because of where I live I rarely see stars at night (to bright -I live between DC and Baltimore). I returned back to bed and I instantly noticed a very bright white object in the sky. The brightness of the object did not change in intensity nor did it blink or change color - just a very solid white object. It was perfectly circular in shape. I would estimate that it was probably a few miles away and was at about a 45 degree angle in the night sky. It wasn’t the moon as this was object was much smaller then the moon. It remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then it started to move rather slowly on a horizontal axis, right to left, stopped, remained stationary, and then moved left to right and would come to a complete stop. It did this for about 10 minutes. After these 10 minutes it started to move again on a horizontal axis, except now it was moving at a much higher speed. When moving at this increased speed the object “wobbled” a lot. Again it moved left to right, would come to a complete stop and then would move left to right. I tried to capture this object on a video using my IPhone but I didn’t have any luck. After about a total of about 20 minutes the object accelerated at a very high speed up into the night sky and disappeared within a few seconds. I was able to take a couple of pictures of the object and am attaching a couple of them.",
3 white oval objects forming a triangle  My wife (driver) and myself were heading SW on Valencia Rd in Tucson AZ. I was looking North out the passanger window toward the mountains when I noticed three oval shaped objects hovering in a locked triangular formation at about 10 o'clock. The objects were white and reflective and too large to be birds. I alerted my wife to what I was seeing. She pulled over while we both observed the triangular formation slowly moving in unison to the west then stopping. Approximately 15 seconds later the three shapes slowly moved outward from the center point of the triangle - paused for about 3 seconds - then simply vanished.. The whole event lasted about 3-5 minutes.,
"Shooting star like  assume not a UFO & man craft of some sort. Just wanted to tell you about it. 9pm MST. it appeared. It basically turned on burners and created a tail. About a foot long from my prospective. lasted about 5 seconds. tail diminished then it disappeared. Travelling completely linear, West to East. Guessing directly over like SLC, Utah. I'm in Boise and saw it while in my hot tub in Boise ID. (it was very bright orange color.) Think I recall it being a white looking star before & after the burning tail.",
"Bright light or lights that brightened, hovered, flashed, moved downward and disappeared, but were replaced by a new light.  My son called me to our window which overlooks the larger city near where we live. He told me that he saw a UFO. I was skeptical and went over to acknowledge, but reassure him and what I saw out our window was brighter and more pronounced than what my video captured. This is my first time to report any sighting. We usually see lights from the city outside our window, but this was different, enough for me to stop and figure out how to report this. The bright light flashed at times and seemed to move at other times. I noticed other strong lights that appeared, came nearby and eventually replaced the prominent light after it lowered and was no longer visible. Some of the lights appeared and disappeared, then reappeared. They all moved toward the same general space when they disappeared. I don’t remember exactly how many I saw altogether. My mother saw the light briefly just after I did with my son.  I work as a mental health therapist. I have two master’s degrees which pertain to my work. I have always been a skeptic about UFO encounters until the past few years, when I have learned more, and am still selective on what I pay attention to online and in the media. I am reporting this because this was unusual and something I haven’t seen before here. I have additional video, but it was too long. I can submit it later if it would help.",
"I was taking to my husband when this thing flew over the sky behind his head  I was sitting at our patio table talking to my husband about a podcast I had listened to that day when out if no where the sky over his head was lit up with green. It was circular and had green light emanating from both sides that reflected the cloud cover. It almost looked like two halves because the center wasn’t lit up. It sailed smoothly like a paper airplane over a grove of pine trees in our neighbors yard and was gone. I didn’t see where it came from, it was like it just appeared mid arc.",
"I looked into the backyard and noticed a round flying disc in the night with different color lights that appeared to shine towards me  I know this was something that could not easily be explained... I knew for sure that it was not a helicopter or an airplane or a star or planet. I have seen ufos before and also while I was with my family a few times, so its not just myself who has experiencing this. My Mom also saw this ufo. The ufo that I saw yesterday seemed to cloak itself off an on. It emitted different color lights that seemed to be directed towards me even from so far away. I went to get my phone camera to capture this thing. It was very unsettling but I managed to capture over 4 minutes of video. I am still scared and find it hard to relax or sleep. I have been looking to move out by myself since I am tired of living with my parents... but now I am very hesitant because I am worried that I am not safe.",

It was super fast looked small but surrounded by a blue like flame around it. Was going so fast and just blinked out.  I got out of my car on poplar st. I noticed something to the west. I started yelling at my mom “do you see that?” As I was running down the road. It looked small but was going so fast that there was light in the middle but like blue flame around it and leaving a tail. In approx 6 to ten seconds it went from when I seen it clear past me to the south and blinked out into nothing. It happened at 7:14 pm on Saturday. Please let me know if you do know what it was. I have seen two other encounters like this. One over Idaho 2005 I believe. That one we did call the police. It was a huge fireball going across the sky and then down the highway we seen the top of the mountain on fire. If you have any info on that please tell me. Last night’s incident has me going nuts. Any information please,
"What looked like red stars then a random blinking materialized the a bubble formed around the light and it took off at speed of light  As I Was looking at the Orion constellation and wanted to look at the star Betelgeuse to see if it had indeed gotten dimmer, I saw what looked like a red star start flying across the sky from a stationary position I was facing west towards the Rocky Mountains it flew south until it was out of sight and then turned around and flew the other way until it was out of sight not more than 1 to 2 minutes later just above the mountain line I saw a white light materialize and flash out of nowhere it flashed about every 5 to 7 seconds until it stayed on and when that happened a clear bubble formed around the light and then it shut off to the north faster than I could blink it seem to leave just a small faint bubble kind of like an air planes contrail but much smaller and much much more different looking it was like the object to move so fast that the bubbles that I had formed around it tried to stay with it so it was like an aftermath circular bubble with a tail facing north my dog was also going crazy and staring at this guy he is a two-year-old German shepherd and very smart dog",
"Stationary green light in the sky for about 3 minutes maybe longer, zipped all weird directions then descends down and disappears  I was taking out the trash at work to the outside dumpsters of the building facing south towards the coastlines and if followed in a straight path, would my guess be, past Delaware. Potentially out in the ocean in the sky. It was a green light that just sat in the sky for about 3-5 minutes and could have been there longer than when I first stepped outside and saw it. I questioned if it were a plane at first but realized it was impossible because there was a plane in the sky pretty further east and I actually was able to compare the two. Once I had finished with the trash, and keeping a close eye on the green light, it had started to zip left and right. It obviously had no indication of being a plane or even some sort of radio or cell tower given it had started to move and was really high in the sky. Higher than any tower man would probably build. I just stared in amazement and astonishment because I’d never seen anything like it before. It zipped left and right and I could just tell it was probably all these weird directions that any flying object know to the public wouldn’t be a plane. Then it almost just rapidly descended downwards and disappeared. My guess is it was probably in the ocean off the coastline of Delaware and potentially a little bit further east than that sprightly. Not east enough to be past Philadelphia.",
"When we arrived at the parking lot in the evening, we saw a circular glowing aircraft pass over the parking lot.  While on vacation in Washington, we went skiing at Crystal Mountain. We got off the bus & we were loading our ski gear into our car. I glanced up and saw something lit up in the sky. I assumed it was a helicopter or airplane so I went back to what I was doing. Then, my mom also looked up and told me to look again. This time, the object was much closer to us and lower to the ground. It slowly & smoothly passed over us at a low elevation - close enough to see that it was circular and had a blueish white glow to it. It was also moving completely silently. I passed over us from north to south and then took a hard turn to the west and disappeared behind the bluffs.",
"A pulsing and powerful orange light that emitted from an unknown object that slowed to a standstill in the sky before ascending west.  I saw something very unusual. Dare I say a UFO. What I feel is that it was not a plane. I was on my run just around Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, CA. What I saw was what I first mistook as a plane flying by in the lower troposphere, but what was unusual was the VERY BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHT it was emitting. Far brighter than any light a plane would be emitting. I saw it flying closer into vision only to see it decelerate in the night sky, almost to a standstill. After watching it linger and continue to emit bright orange in the sky as it seemed to approach from the eastern sky, I saw it once again accelerate… continuing to emit its bright orange luminosity. It flew away into the horizon into the Oceanside western sky. As it flew west, it seemed to ascend further into the stratosphere, and then mesosphere, until its bright orange light faded as I kept peering from my phone to the UFO . It’s all in the name, UFO, unidentified flying object. So, I can’t tell you what it was, because I honestly don’t know. I doubt it was a plane though. If this were a drone, it had a very powerful orange emitter to still be seen if it ascended towards the mesosphere.",

Extremely bright came on directly beneath object. As a vertical beam of light projecting from object to the ground, scanning movement. Shape of beam rectangular. Viewers in beam momentarily, nearly blinding brightness. Overwhelming eeriness prior to, during sighting turning into fear during and after. Object with beam of light continued moving slowly with beam falling on the open snow and ice covered field which includes farmland, fencing. And a large electrical transmission line.

"A stirng of brilliant white lights on a craft  It was a totally clear/cloudless day. I witnessed a string of extremely bright white lights glowing high in the sky to the NE/92117 moving very slowly. The lights were not normal plane/helicopter/etc. lights. They were brilliant white. As I watched for several minutes, it came closer yet remained at a high altitude. That was when I clearly saw its shape of a rectangle or large square, silver, shiny, no wings, a single bright white light in the center front, and a string of the brilliant glowing incredible white separate lights all across the back section from end to end. There was no sound as it moved very slowly to the W. I saw and heard 3-4 private small planes go across the sky at much lower altitude, passing under the craft above them. I wondered what it must look like to those pilots, assuming they would look high above them. I watched at least 15 minutes until the craft was so far W towards the ocean that I lost sight of it. When it actually went overhead where I was/92111, I could see the string of separate lights all across the back end of the rectangle or large square, and the single light in the center front. Only the string of lights glowed brilliantly and could easily have been seen by anyone looking up. They caught your eye because of their brilliance. The craft kept moving the entire time at an extremely slow speed. It made me feel as if it were observing. I kept looking for other people to watch the amazing sight but none were around. Even though the craft was at a high altitude, it must have been huge to be able to see the string of lights on the back end glowing so brightly in the blue sky. I'll never forget it.",

"Standing still then disappearing. Then sighted again moving very quickly.  I was driving on 83 South with my girlfriend yesterday during the day when there was completely blue skies. I look up to admire the nice day and blue sky when I noticed a plane in the sky because of its contrail. To the right of the planes path was a very bright small circle that looked like a star, but it was the middle of a bright sunny day so I knew it was not a star. The difference between the plane and its contrail and this object was very noticeable. I pointed it out to my girlfriend and we both looked at it for a couple seconds then went around a bend with the tree line blocking our view for a few seconds, and when we came around the bend it was gone. Just about 1 minute later further down 83 and now into Baltimore City…I saw a less bright and dull white circle moving extremely fast in the other direction then completely lost view of it. It was moving with no contrail and was also faster than any flying object I’ve ever seen. There was no sound either.",
Small white cross shape object  This Is the second time seen this particular object. Have Amazon parrot had him outside he was the 1 that alerted me to this he was looking upwards made weird noise happen to look up and saw it again crossed shaped object flying low probably less than 200 feet up in the air white color noiseless not a bird or drone let alone a toy plane flying pretty fast going east towards Los Angeles less than 5 seconds sighting. I consider myself a semi expert on aircraft specially military . Size of this object small I would say around 4~5 feet long I would estimate.. first time saw it like a month ago around same time this time going west towards the ocean against the wind. Am totally baffled by this,
"It was really hard to see what it was all of the crafts appeared to be a long ways away.

"Saw ISS/Satellite/meteor shaped object cross the sky at a slow speed, flickering, with two identical objects jettisoned to the rear  My kids and I went outside to play in a large snow pile I had plowed on our driveway a couple day’s before. It was right after dusk so I gave my kids flashlights to play in the snow tunnels they had previously made and I sat in the snow supervising their safety. It was very cold but high pressure so the sky was perfectly clear and I was enjoying the sky. My son sat next to me so I could adjust his hat and right as I went to adjust his hat I saw something moving in the sky to the west heading east. It had a fairly bright intensity of white light, slightly brighter than a star and was moving slow like when’s you see something in a polar orbit like a satellite. As it moved to the right of my viewing location it began to sparkle like maybe it was entering the atmosphere. After a second or two the sparkling stoped and it continued to move at the same speed and direction for another few seconds before there was a flash and two perfectly identical circular but slightly smaller objects with lesser light intensity were jettisoned behind the primary object and outwards at the exact time. The smaller objects quickly lost intensity and speed as the they separated and the primary objects continued on the same trajectory until it disappeared at the horizon. Myself, my son, and daughter all saw the objects.",

"I was trying to take a pic of an unusual Moon shape that I had never seen.The Moon wd not show up in my phone camera lens, just Lights.  I am a Customer Service office worker at a manufacturing plant here in Austin, Texas. I have been working from home for the last few weeks but still have to go into my Office a few times a week in order to process specific customer orders and print off needed paperwork on the office printer. I went into my office on Sunday evening on 2/06/2022 to get some things ready for the upcoming week working at home. I ended up staying later than expected, leaving my Office at about 11:00 p.m. I took my usual route home down Interstate Highway 183 North heading toward Cedar Park, Texas. As I was driving, I noticed that the Moon was an unusual shape that I had never noticed before. It was a Crescent-shape moon, but the crescent shape was on the Bottom of the moon, not on the Left or Right as I have normally seen it. In looking it up, I see it is called a ‘Waxing Crescent’ moon. I decided to pull to the right-side median on the Interstate to take a picture. I attempted to take a photo of the Moon, but when I held the phone camera up, the Moon did not appear in the photo. I looked with my eyes and the Moon was there--I looked at my phone and no Moon was visible. I thought this was very strange. I could only see in the phone camera 2 Blue lights and another white cylinder-type light above them. I snapped a photo of where the Moon was supposed to be and where only the lights were visible at 11:24 p.m. The address where the Photo was take is about 12990 Research Blvd, Austin, TX 78750, as you can see the ""Austin's Automotive Specialists"" car repair building and Sign in the photo. They are located at Hwy 183 South, whereas, I was traveling Hwy 183 North up on the Interstate, pulled over and took the Photo to my left-hand side. I pulled back into traffic and continued down Hwy 183 North-bound. I looked closer at the Photo and could see the two (2) Blue lighted objects almost appeared florescent and a Cylinder-shaped object above them that appeared to be lighted, and an additional four (4) objects above the Cylinder that appeared to be further away. At 11:42 p.m. I sent the Photo I had taken to my daughter to verify what I was seeing. She was able to take my Photo and sharpen the images a bit, but it’s still hard to clearly define the Cylinder-shaped ship. I have my original photo taken, and the one my daughter sharpened and they are definitely very unusual. I am still not sure why the Moon would not appear in my phone camera lens. That is also strange! I wanted to report the sighting. Thank you very much.",

"Daytime, close up sighting of UFO  On February 7, at approximately 11 am., I observed an unknown air craft in the airspace above Henry county Kentucky. My initial thought, it was an ultra light aircraft. Quickly realized it wasn’t. In fact, I realized it was nothing I had ever seen before. It was a couple thousand feet altitude. It initially appeared to be towing something behind it. The craft was shiny and highly reflective. It appeared to about the same size as a pick up truck. It seemed to change shape. Eventually this craft ascended into the blue and disappeared. This sighting was at a close distance of about 1/2 mile. I saw this thing very clearly. It was not a plane, helicopter, blimp or drone. I took pics with my cell phone. This encounter has left me very disturbed. I have never observed, or claimed to have observed a UFO before this incident. I know what I saw.",

"3 very bright red light objects (circular) that came from the southern (downtown Atlanta) horizon and slowly rose above and over the sk  We went outside to see fireworks for the midnight time as it was new years 2022. Exactly at midnight (a couple seconds after maybe), 2 very bright equal in size/symmetrical red light objects (circular) came from the southern (downtown Atlanta) horizon and slowly rose above and over the sky and behind my house. The objects were then seen again after passing behind the house and at which point started accelerating very fast in the same direction as it had been traveling. Altitude always stayed steady throughout the process. Shortly after this, another one was spotted - again same direction, etc identical to the prior objects (even in the direction and speed etc and light intensity) over the southern horizon. This object is the one that is video taped as noted in the evidence.

It passed NW of my location, covering the field of view in 2–3 min. As it moved out of sight, a second appeared in the SW and behaved likewise except that it seemed to pass slightly closer. As it moved out, a third appeared and followed a parallel, but slightly closer track. As THAT moved out, a fourth appeared and passed even closer. The last three may have been redder than the first. The fourth may have exhibited very slight, rapid variations in brightness. No sound audible above background noise—fireworks in town (ca. 1 mi. SE), traffic, and so on. No one to whom I have spoken since saw these objects.",

(I wanted to video but opened in camera mode and snapped a pic instead. 12:08 - picture. What I saw was a lot bigger visually than what the camera shows. hurried and went to video, because it looked so different from anything I've seen in the sky. It seemed to be hovering - like a helicopter would, in my mind, like it was watching the fireworks. for some reason, i waved haha. then noticed it was now moving... that's when my nerves started freaking out. 12:08 - 1st video of object- while filming, i could tell it was slowly moving in my direction, not at me, but straight from East to west. I went to move to get a better angle to video, and my sandal was frozen to the ground, so after pulling a few times, I moved and started filming again. 12:09 - Continuing the filming of the 1st object I saw. (seemingly to slowly move West/SW and possibly climbing.)  Notes: 1. While watching the video back, I noticed that there was a lower object shown at the end of the video, but didn't notice it then, because when I looked back to my left, to walk back to my back door, i saw 2 more coming from same direction as first, and they were also moving very slowly. 2. From the time I started videoing the first one, in my mind, I kept repeating, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared. I was so filled with fear. After waving and noticing the first one slowly moving somewhat in my direction, I couldn't get the image of it coming over my house and then all the other scary thoughts that go with that were running through my head.. If any of them would've come towards my house, I wouldn't have been able to continue to video. I felt that scared! 3. Because it was so cold and my nerves were on high edge, I was shaking a lot and videos were not steady. *the object's movements were very slow and steady. 4. There was what seemed like a bright, big, close star or possible satellite?? from viewing that, it can help see the movement of the objects as it/they pass in front of it. 5. It was clear - with some possible haze - I couldn't tell for sure. but I could see the constellation Orion (so small compared to ""bright star' low in the south sky, which was up and further over to the west from where all the objects seemed to just blink out. At first, I thought they faded into a possible haze I couldn’t see, but really it was as if they blinked in and out a few times then just vanished. 6. Weather - Cold/freezing, but no precipitation or wind that i noticed. 7. I can send a video of typical air traffic and a map of where I am, in comparison to PDX airport. Pattern of most air traffic I see, follows I5 direction, going South to North, to the airport or north to south, away. 12:10-Video of next 2 objects and notice a third separate one in the frame. I try to turn my phone sideways - you can still track them from the steady bright white light. 12:11 Continued filming of those 3 objects, but starting with my phone sideways. talking to myself - saying that it was as if they were watching the fireworks. the movements of two objects traveling together, seemed so weird to me. Like they are separate, and doing a little dance together. 12:12 - moving to try and capture them as they moved away West, then they just seemed to flicker out.) 12:12 - tried to focus on bright white spot, to see if I could find them again. nope 12:13 - Then Saw one more coming from my left (East). I think I whispered something like ""Don't scare me, Oh my God, there's another one"", and I was so scared, i stopped filming sky, and started walking to my back door to go inside. Then lifted my phone to continue to film the object, while standing next to my door.  *The objects did not make any sound that I could hear. At all. (And I can often hear flight traffic from planes and helicopters).  Went inside, and my heart was pounding out of my chest. seemed like my fear senses were on overdrive... I was so scared that I ran up to where my friend was staying and said in a loud voice, Sheryl, Sheryl, I think I just saw ufo's - Sheryl.... She didn't respond, so I didn't want wake her. so I called my friend in MT (12:28), who I was talking with a little after 11- Sharing the videos and writing ""Dude, it was closer than the picture shows, like my heart is still racing. I was so scared to be out there, like I even backed up close to the door, missing some of it, I was literally that scared.""  Could not go to sleep - so worried that I'd have little visitors in my room.. started texting with my sister in Mt, around 3 who happened to just respond to my earlier happy new years text. I was so grateful to be texting with her, because I was still so scared and couldn't fall asleep. I ended up only sleeping maybe 1/2 after her text, when i then woke and ended up not being able to fall back asleep. Details I shared with her. *They were a lot closer than what my camera could catch. *So scared my heart didn't stop beating hard for at least 1/2 hour. *Seemed like they were just pulsating. no flicking on and off light patterns, like typical aircrafts at night. *No other color (white,red,green, etc) other than Amber-like glow - kind of pulsating. I'd say I'd compare it to staring at a part of a candle flame. *""Moving going from east to west and I swear they seemed to be hovering around my area, before slowly moving off. I was so scared. and then they just disappeared one after the other. After moving towards West, They just kind of flickered out of sight. *Hard to tell, but it definitely seemed like some sort of vehicle - bigger than a helicopter. appeared to be between a circle and triangle, maybe Triangle with more rounded corners . possibly the amber light was deeper in color in the area under the edges. The whole bottom was this candle amber like and didn't seem like it stayed solid - color in movement like a candle would or pulsating somehow. *Seemed like they were watching the fireworks. Moved a lot steadier than what my camera captured. they kind of sometimes flicked in and out. It was so scary and amazing at the same time. The first couple seemed to literally be hovering for a while, before slowly traveling to the west. *My cat was so freaked out that I found her hiding under my bed. could be because of the fireworks, but when i finally got her out from under there, she stayed on my chest for at least an hour. (usually just sleeps on the end of my bed), and when she got up, she still laid close by my side. She was acting off all night and very skittish. I did not sleep - so scared.  I wish my phone could’ve captured what my eyes saw.  1/1 11:20am Text with My uncle who is retired, but flew fighter jets, then flew for other sec of govt, then i think around 30 yrs commercial... What I wrote to him, and then his response. ""I saw them hovering then moving slowly to the right, They were so much closer and larger than what seems in this video. I noticed them after watching a firework in the sky for New Year Eve. I look a little to the right and bam saw the hovering and then moving slowly to the west. He asked if the white dot was a plane - No, I think it was a low bright star (but looked bigger and closer than other stars and Orion that i could see in the sky. maybe it was close bright satalight? White dot - no movement, has slight sparkle)- you can use it to see how slow they're moving and how they move past it. Honestly as they moved to the west and maybe a little higher, they just vanished. First I saw one, then 2 with a sep one... then another came from the left as they disappeared in the west sky, more came... I think I saw 5-6. No red white or green lights, no flashing, just this pulsating glow. For as close as they were, no sound. in one of the videos you can see that i was so scared my phone went to my feet walking towards my back door, because I was going to run into the house, but then I shot the phone back into the sky to capture the last UAP. From the videos it sent him, he said that he saw no landing lights, so flashing on off patterns, no white or red lights. I then sent him video of airplanes at night - flying their typical north south pattern to pdx. Said it's nothing that he can recognize or explain, and recommended that I file a report.",
"Blinking but sporadic  I was standing outside last night around 630 PM, but it has been many nights now on and off. I see these light on occasion. I notice all of the Police drones and airplanes because I'm right next door to a private airport. The airport has a helicopter for a hospital or for the military right there as well. I'm right next door to state Police building and a National Gaurd base. Also, down the street, is where the Sheriff's park their vehicles and a jail is located down there as well. I've been noticing these strange blinking lights in the sky. They appear to be almost metaphysical the way they blink. I've noticed them on other videos on YouTube in suspect sky videos. It's a moving craft but that blinks like an airplane, but it's the way it blinks that's impossible. It's completely impossible for humans. I've noticed them following me from McClean Virginia to Leesburg. I've had wierd events happen to me now with serious winds and strange darkness fall upon me at random times. I have proof of finding ancient pieces of the comet that killed the dinosaurs and perfectly preserved dinosaur bones and possible alien artifacts. I was driven off the road by total strangers at 70 mph into a ditch only two weeks ago. All my money was stolen out of my account at the same time. Now I'm surround by Police and Military who are sending up there own craft to confuse me. Theirs a big difference in the UFOs and the man-made craft. The Police and National Gaurd are trying to mimic the Alien craft to confuse me. This is not a hoax. I have the rocks and dinosaur bones to prove I'm telling the truth. My car is totaled. Some fanatic tried to murder me for no reason. I think it might have to do with the blinking lights. The UFOs have shot laser shows close to me in McClean. Impossible for humans to do. Spinning laser lights. They are up there right now. Look for impossible blinking. Those are UFOs. The Police and military are trying to cover it up by flying craft with blinking lights near the UFOs. That's because they know those are alien lights. Look up especially on clear nights. You will probably see them. You will see the Police trying to cover it up. They are here and I think they are dangerous.",
Orange round circle in western sky by Bozeman MTmall and East main area was not fireworks it hovered and shot up into northern west sky  We went outside to watch some fireworks that were going off for the new year celebration and I looked up into the sky to the western or southern part and I saw an orange hovering object and I told my husband and daughter to look and then they saw it as well it was low and round and orange and hovering. It seemed close to us I asked my daughter to go in the house to get my phone and by the time she came out and I got video to work it went halfway up towards upper sky and then it disappeared into a tiny dot. They were also intrigued and said definitely it was UFO! It Was very strange indeed not the first Ufo I have ever seen but definitely a unique experience! Just wondering if anyone else in Bozeman Montana saw it tonight?,
"2 lights flying across the sky.  There were 2 orange lights moving across the sky southwest to the northeast. First light flew out of site and second light followed the same path. The second light was in the front of the object and when passed you could see the light disappear, but could see the object then it disappeared behind the clouds.",
"Saw round orange light with no blinking lights and no sound. Flying south to north over northern Manhattan.  I was walking southbound on the east side of the boulevard. I saw a round orange light going on a northerly direction. It was not very high. There were no flashing lights, green on the right wing and red on the left, so I knew that it was not an airplane. It had no other flashing lights so I also knew that it was not a helicopter. It made no sound whatsoever. It was also moving faster than an airplane or helicopter. Since it looked unusual to me I took out my phone to take a video. I did this even before I realized that it was not making any sounds. The route is used by airplanes going to land at LaGuardia Airport but you always hear the airplanes and see the flashing lights. There some low hanging clouds and I also noticed that there was not the straight beam of light you see at night when airplanes have their lights on. The next day I was walking northbound and an airplane went by. I couldn’t see it because it was goofy and musty but the noise was very loud and unmistakable. This was no airplane or helicopter. I have tried to attach the video but is not happening.",
red fireball.  moveing vary slowly glowing red was seen hanging in the fog looked vary low in the sky.,
out to smoke looked up and 2 dark shapes above clouds with light around them and flickering  2 unusual shapes in the sky lights flickering was round and close together i asked for something to take a picture with and i used my phone and my boyfriends phone and a digital camera was strange no dogs barked no sound from the direction of the lights wanted to go back inside but we watched it until it looked as if it flew away first one then the other.,
"2022 New Years ufo sighting UK, @1am NY day caught on phone.  2022 new year ufo sighting UK. Taken approx 1am on January 1st.. just 1 hour into the new year on jan 1st 2022.. While outside watching the last of the fireworks I saw a green and red light flashing slowly in the sky. I obviously assumed it was a plane for a moment however it then started to move in a totally random fashion... Realising it was a UFO or maybe 2 I ran in and grabbed my iphone 11 pro, just before I managed to start filming the initial lights blinked out, then this light reappeared for just over 30 seconds.. unfortunately i didnt have time to change settings on my phone (ie to 4k 30fps) so its only in HD 1080p 25fps and very noisy footage but it was amazing to see... I stayed outside until 7am hoping it would return but it didnt... it almost seems to blink out as a big firework goes off... The initial lights, red and green were circling each other darting around the area of sky in a rapid motion. there was no noise (when the fireworks stopped for a minute) heres the link to the footage i did manage to catch, please feel free to contact me for any more details. I can also send you the file from my phone although its compressed with h.264 codec so isnt much better resolution wise. I work as a designer and musician so i work alot in photoshop and after effects etc so im going to have a play with the camera footage (increase a still image resolution in photoshop etc... not sure what i will be able to do in after effects though as im just a motion designer, see work on glenwilsoncreative.com as im an art director and my technical skills are not amazing to see what i mean). its more interesting to watch frame by frame as it seems to move in an S shape in the sky.  youtube link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k_F4A2swvk",
out to smoke looked up and 2 dark shapes above clouds with light around them and flickering  ok on Saturday the first of new year at 3:05 am me and my boyfriend went and out for a smoke ciggaretee and opend the garage door just a little bit large enough for me bryan crews to stoop under and when i looked up like i do often to look at the stars it was cloudy and 2 big ass dark shapes were what it looked like was above the cloud cover and circler with light all around them 2 of these things not too far apart from each other. i told my boyfriend to take pics with his phone but didnt think we got it on video or pictures so i used my phone which is worse then his phone really and a digital camera only my boyfriends camera on his i phone took exellent pictures of these things and a video with it flickering lights. the position of where it was theres nothing over that way that could have made the sky look the way it did it wasnt coming from the ground it was coming from above the clouds and up there clouds move change but this thing it didnt change and it stayed a long time i think we stoped with the pics pretty early cause we didnt think it worked. it didnt make a noise and it stayed there untill 5:30 am when it finally slowly faded off light vanishing like it just lazily flew away both of em. most amazing thing ive ever seen and pretty frightening.,
"V-Formation lights with an orb like cloud around it came from the west and moved down then East, large with no sound.  We were watching for shooting stars and out of the west an “>” formation strip of light with a cloud like orb around it from the west then went slightly south then East over the ocean. It was silent and left us silent. It moved slowly but a little faster almost airplane speed. Then 30ish minutes later an even bigger aircraft of the same formation cane from the west and moved East slowly and silent. More visible. It was unexplainable. Thought it was a bird or a military ship but the movement was like none other.",
"Glowing yellow/orange teardrop or oval shape.  I was standing in my backyard in the darkness looking towards the west when I observed an oval or teardrop snapped craft traveling parallel to the horizon on a northerly heading at an altitude between 800 and 1200 AGL. It made no sound at all, yet it was less than 3 statute miles away from me with a velocity well over 500 kts. The entire craft was glowing very brightly, mostly orange, with some yellow in the center. The exact shape was not discernible, due to it being completely veiled in the aura-like glow.",
"We saw an object with a ring of red outer circle, yellow inner moving in a straight line from SSE to NNE.  Whilst watching fireworks on New Years eve / morning we suddenly saw an object moving in a totally different direction. Very large red circle with yellow center. It did not move in the way fireworks do (i.e. it was not up and down) and it did not move or look like a plane ( Planes to and from Houston IAH airport move in different directions and much slower. This was quite fast, moved in a downward trajectory but not near any airport. Both my husband and I independently saw it and asked 'What is that?' Definitely not a firework, plane, bird or anything we have seen before. Not normal.",
"Heard unusual noise unlike planes I'm used to. Saw craft in distance looking like an ALCM with a brown haze around it.  I was sitting on my front porch. Weather was clear and warm for January. Was mid-afternoon. Can't remember the exact day. I heard a sound somewhat like a small private prop. plane, but different. I live just a mile from Roanoke-Blacksburg regional airport. I like aircraft, so I was interested to see what this odd-sounding plane was. I looked around, but didn't see anything at first. Then, I looked up and toward the south, and up a few thousand feet. I saw a craft that looked, as best I can describe, like an air launched cruise missile. A long, but not cylindrical fuselage with vertical and horizontal stabs at the rear. No wings. Maybe a bit larger than a private plane. It had a brown haze around it. The haze and no wings is what made me want to report this incident. Aircraft flying by before this at altitude were very clear with no haze. It was flying level in a south-south easterly direction. It's speed was unremarkable at the moment I saw it. My binoculars were just inside my front door, about eight feet from where I was sitting. I reached in and grabbed them to get a better look at the craft, but it had disappeared in those few seconds I had my back turned. I can't swear that the noise I heard was this craft, since I'm so close to the airport, but it did get me looking all around. I have looked at photos of our military drones, but none look like what I saw. The ALCM is the closest thing to what it looked like.",
"Strange object witnessed in the sky, from back and front yard of our home.  A reddish orange spherical object was witnessed by my wife, child, and myself, first from the back yard and then the front. This object not only moved in a way that no Aircraft or pilot could possibly move, (Speed, Direction, etc) but also made absolutely no sound at all! Our Dog was barking heavily at it as well, which was also strange! After defying all laws of physics, it just disappeared.",
Rectangle best described as a railroad boxcar on its edge. I could see it was 3 dimensional w/square end and bright white luminescent.  It's shape was that of a railroad boxcar but apparently outside of our atmosphere. There were no contrails from entering the atmosphere. It was large enough from my vantage point to block most of the big dipper and from my vantage point it was silent. It wasn't leaving any contrails so I assumed it was outside of our atmosphere. It traveled in an almost flat concave arc and came from the direction of SonoraMexico to the no fly zone over Fort Huachuca army testing grounds east range. I then lost sight. I have mentioned this only to my immediate family.,
"Multiple donut shaped lights seen regularly hovering and moving over SE Belleview  Have been seeing these flickering multicolored star-like lights in this vicinity for years. My daughter got a telescope for Christmas and we finally have been able to zoom in on the lights. They appear in the shape of a donut with the center and four wings almost like cardinal points on a compass, lightless. However between these points are hundreds of small lights. The lights vary in color but are mostly white. The objects tend to hang out in the same area for hours when I notice them. Over the time period they are around, they flicker and slowly move up in down and back and forth within a zone in the sky. Eventually, they dim out and disappear. I am hoping to get video or pictures to add to this site soon. Tonight we saw four, we were able to get 3 in the telescope lens and they appear equidistant apart or close to it. They are not StarLInk satellites because they do not move across the sky in that manner and also there are less of them than in a StarLink group.",
"We saw a triangle of lights moving very fast in the sky.  At around 1:05 AM my girlfriend and I were looking up at the stars and thought we saw a shooting star. We both saw 3 lights in the shape of a triangle moving at a very fast speed. We checked Flight Aware and there were no aircraft nearby. It was also too high and too fast to be a quadcopter drone. There were no nav/strobe/or beacon lights that would normally be on an airplane. Altitude is unknown, but was above 4,000 ft MSL. Craft was near the Daytona class C airspace and the Orlando class B airspace where transponder and ADS-B is required.",
They are here controlling people  Saw ships. Then started getting really bad head aches then started hearing them. Then seeing them then they came to my motel room and was communicating with me. Put visions in my head about my family and I that came true in less than a year. Orbs in my trailer around me a lot. Once a week or so. They can block people's vision and memory. I have lots more they won't leave me alone. I need help,
"It was completely dark and at first the object looked like a star; then I zoomed with my phone and I saw it moving in a circular way.  I was on the balcony at 4am; it was completely dark, clear sky, and I saw a circular object moving. At first it looked not moving, then it did a sort of infinite sign; then it moved in circles. During my recording It appeared another one close to it; Please see the videos.",
"It’s filed on iPhone off flat screen over Tetons  I’m in my kitchen in lake Jackson Texas. We have a flat screen on the wall that we turn on to watch wildlife and snow in the Jackson Hole Wyoming area. I had just turned the tv on and a huge fireball flew over the Grand Tetons, I took a video of the event on mr phone. The size of it was huge. It was still dark over the Tetons so you can see the event. Wanting to see if anyone else seen this.",
There are 6 strange flying objects that appear in a video I recorded. They’re movement was irregular & they glowed at times.  The objects that I saw were only visible through the camera but not to the naked eye. They’re not orbs from light. They change shape and sometimes we’re glowing. They appeared and disappeared back and forth. Sometimes they were blurry but I was able to capture a screenshot that shows all 6 of them clearly. I have a video and a screenshot from it that I can send you.,
"Driving on the highway- I saw a teardrop craft that crossed the length of the sky in less than 2 seconds.  I’m a skeptical believer. But I’ve never seen anything that defined a phenomenon until earlier this year. Driving home from Canada, my boyfriend was driving and I was looking out the window at the sunset. I caught a craft that managed to cross the entire sky in under 3 seconds. The craft was cone shaped with lights on it, and was approximately the height and distance of a landing plane. The speed was what was shocking. I’m a scientist, and the speed that this craft crossed the sky and disappeared was bewildering. I was in shock for a few minutes after. I knew it couldn’t have been any sort of man driven craft due to how fast it was going, and it was a miracle I saw it. I was completely sober and wide awake as well. Even though the sighting only lasted seconds, I can visualize every detail.",
Stars or drones?  Every night when the stars are shining on a clear night anyone can point a led flashlight or green/blue laser at them and within seconds they will start fluttering around like a balloon that tied to something. They stay within a close area from witch you get it to move from.70% of the stars visible I have made move around and shown lol to s of ppl. I would like to know a re e we living in a simulation? Or is a sky cloak for protection? I've had large drones or airplanes start flying big circles above me after shining lasers the object soon after starting but still have not met any men in black face to face wtf is in our sky!?! 360-((deleted)) leave message are text please,
Bright ball of light  I was on my way back from the store and I pulled up in the driveway I noticed I have something following me I looked up and it's the big ball of bright light it's like it's always there I noticed it first 3 years ago sometimes it follows me sometimes it doesn't but most of the time it stays above my home to the right of it just a little it's always there I don't know what to do I don't know what to think I'm sure to be there again tonight I'll get back to you guys and let you know I got pictures too I'm fixing to post them,
Light bar / Cigar shape  12/2/21 at 6:24 PM cigar shape object light bar traveling north east. Object appeared in the city of Garden Grove CA for at 10 to 15 seconds.,
"i walked out on my deck to watch the skies like i do every night that time and I immediately noticed 3 very bright lights in a line  i have a video of the incident. there were 3 very bright lights in the night sky, way brighter than the stars, and they were lined up in a perfectly straight line. they looked as if they were blinking or the lights were going in and out of view, not in harmony. they sat there until i went inside and it freaked me out for days now. I routinely go outside on my back deck and watch the skies at night waiting for sightings and this was outside above my house. i have it on video. i know my view of the sky very well and this was never there before which prompted me to start recording. to reassure myself that it was one giant craft or three individual craft, and not orions belt, I have been monitoring the exact position of the sighting every night at the same time and what i saw has not returned and cannot be found in my sky anywhere since the sighting. very strange. while looking in its direction my vision felt distorted like the image was wavy as well. blew my mind. my dog began acting very strange and barking and hiding under the deck table as well. hes a huge dog too. he was freightened.",
"I witnessed a cigar-shaped light slowly travel over my head before disappearing.  I just got home from work and was getting out of my car when my attention was initially grabbed by a bright shooting star that I saw in my peripheral vision to the north-west. I looked up and saw another unusual light to the south-west which I then turned to look at. It was a big bright cigar-shaped light. It was travelling slowly and steadily in a roughly north-eastern direction. I have lived near an airport for over 30 years and am used to seeing airplanes and drones but it was immediately clear that this was something that I hadn't seen before. It was a thick line of light. It did not blink or change. It made no sound. I stopped what I was doing to look at it. The sky was clear.  I pulled out my phone to record a video but later discovered, to my great disappointment, that it was in picture mode instead of video mode so all I got was one blurry photo. The object was very bright and to my eye it appeared larger and had a haze around it, giving it a halo effect, which was not captured in the picture my phone took. Interestingly the picture also captured a second oddly shaped light which I did not notice myself at the time.  I estimate that the object was visible for between one and two minutes. It slowly travelled in a straight line. If straight up is 0 degrees then I observed it from about 45 degrees to the south-east until it was about 15 degrees to the north-west, travelling not quite over my head but a bit to the north of me. Then over the span of about 15 seconds the light slowly and steadily faded out. It seemed like an oddly long time for the light to dim. I continued to watch that part of the sky for another minute. The object was big enough that I felt that I should still be able to see it even without the light but it was as if the object itself had faded away.",
It was a bright light that stayed beside my cat for about 10 minute then disappeared. About 10 minutes later it was in front of me  The bright light followed my car for about 10 minutes. After that it was on the side of my car and then disappeared abruptly.. After about 10 minutes it reappeared again in front of my car and stayed in the same position. It was very bright and circular. I got out of my car and took a picture and when I got home and zoomed n you could see that it was man made and there were little circles all around the outside edges edges. I screenshot the zoomed in photo and attached that too . This happened on Highway 260 between Springerville and Pinetop in a dark secluded area near Sunrise Ski Resort.,
"Bright white cigarette shaped silent craft moving north fairly slowly, it was slender with flat ends, not rounded.  There were no lights, there was no trail, no wings, no sound. Just a solid white slender cylinder. It was dark outside and the craft may have been glowing white, or just reflecting the sun from beyond the horizon.",
"Green cylinder shaped UFO early December in southern Utah  I know this is a little older but I hope the data might help. I was heading home evening of December 2nd from just east of Kanab Utah, a little after 6 p.m. I'm not 100% sure on the timing I'm using the timestamp of my photo for the exact moment I realized it was a UFO. Oddly enough though it was this thing was very bright and huge. However absolutely nothing appears in my photo. Anyhow, somewhere around 3 to 5 Mi before Highway 14 headed north on 89 I noticed a green comment. Which really stood out to me because I have red green Vision, most every light in the sky just looks yellow to me. As I came closer to the junction it fell out of my view oh, because of some Knowles, for a moment and I didn't see it again until I was heading west on 14. As I drove up the hill near an area we call Elkridge on the 14. I saw the comet again and it seemed bigger, later I realized I may have witnessed it entering our atmosphere. Anyhow, as I traveled further west on the 14 hi kept looking up at it and it seemed to get larger and larger. As I approached the Duck Creek area traveling around 50 miles an hour it went from a comment do a thick green line. To me it seemed like the size of the object kept increasing. I assumed that meant it was coming down. As I passed through Duck Creek Village I began to notice that it was not a comment. So I started driving a little slower to keep my eye on it. Just west of Duck Creek Village is a little pond. Maybe a hundred yards west of that pond is where I decided to pull over. In fact I was so stunned I believe I stopped in the middle of the road and then a second later realized I had better pull off to the side. My photo may even have GPS coordinates on it I will check. At this point it still seemed very high in the air. So I pulled my camera out, cell phone, and decided I was going to try to get a picture when I looked up to get a picture it seemed as though it had come much further down in altitude and was hovering above me. So I snapped the photo not realizing that my flash was still engaged. I looked at the photo and there was nothing in it so I hurry up turn the flash off reached up with my phone to get another picture, but it was gone. I believe it was heading north. A co-worker told me that his wife saw the same green comment as she was heading back from Richfield and to her it appeared to be over the Panguitch area which is north of where I was at 7:25. She said she saw it at around 9:15. The UFO / object was huge I couldn't even begin to tell you how big. Enormous is all I can say. It was lime green, and very long with what was either a dark colored or black band around it towards the front. Maybe one quarter of the vehicles length behind the front. If that makes sense. I am terrible at writing so if you want better explanation feel free to call. I left my name and number on the hotline. Andy, 435-590-6775. Here in southern Utah is not uncommon to see weird things in the sky. I have several incidences that left me wondering, what the heck was that. But this was the only time I could definitively say I saw the real thing. A UFO.  My second youngest brother and I also have a very strange Experience which happened when we were teenagers visiting our uncle in Kanab Utah. I'll keep it brief, about the middle of the day we were stretching with each other. Maybe less than two feet apart. Clear skies and no weather yet a bright orange light enveloped the room we were in. So bright we couldn't see each other. Less than 2 feet apart. My brother was so terrified I did not run outside to see what it was. This experience was around 26 years ago. Don't know if you'd be interested but I wouldn't mind telling about that one too.",
"Horizontal String of lights 800-1500 feet up.  At first glance, I though it might be a small passenger plane with all of the windows screens open, but there were no other lights (on wings or tail), and it didn't move like a plane. Moved slowly traveling North. I took my phone out to video it and it then went strait up and lights faded away slowly.",
"The object was cigar/pencil shaped, and was glowing yellow with what appeared to be a line of discrete solid yellow lights.  At the date and time indicated above I saw a cigar shaped object in the night sky around 7:30 pm. It was fully illuminated in yellow. It moved silently about 45 degrees from the horizon and moving east northeast at about a 15 degree climb. It was only a few seconds that I saw it. No time to grab a camera. It seemed to nose up and then faded out completely and disappeared. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen before. This is in Phoenix AZ, and was over a Sky Harbor Airport flight path, so maybe was caught on radar? I was in the military and recently retired as an engineer. It was not a conventional aircraft, flare, helicopter, meteor, kit. It was a cloudless, clear, still evening and no lightning was present. the object was totally silent, and moved in a deliberate steady trajectory. When it disappeared, the lights seemed to 'dissolve' into nothing. I was in my backyard and just happened to look up and see it. There was no time to grab a camera.",
Looks like dominoe  I took a photo of the moon and saw this ufo that looks like a black ufo with ten green lights where the dots go,
"Boomerang, no lights, silent  Tonight at approximately 8:30 while looking up at the stars, I noticed a dark object moving through the sky. It was difficult to estimate distance and altitude. Though, I would say it was maybe at the altitude a helicopter flies. There were no lights or sound. It was moving at a speed consistent with a helicopter. My sighting lasted only about 10 seconds. My best estimate of the shape was something like a boomerang. It moved through the sky very smoothly unlike the flapping of a bird’s wings. Though I imagine if I misestimated the altitude, it’s feasible that it was a large bird gliding. After discussing it with a third party with pilot training, it was also mentioned that it may have been a B2 bomber.",
"Huge stationary yellow/orange orbs in triangle formation  Last night I witnessed something very, very strange. Around 7:30 p.m. I looked southeasterly out into the night at the ocean and see 3 huge yellow lights forming a slightly obtuse symetrical triangle of the size range of a football field to 2 football fields, lighting up in unison and making no sound or movement then in three or 4 seconds completely disappear in unison. Super big, quiet, suspended perfectly in midair and possibly being a quarter mile to a couple miles away and maybe half that in altitude above sea level. I have never seen anything like it. It was surreal. And then what appeared to me to be a military plane flew in from the south, which I captured on video, right through the airspace of the 3 huge mysterious triangle of lights. Then after it has passed a single light identical to the 3 that formed a triangle suddenly appears (not moving - my camera moves to catch it) for a few seconds, which i also capture on video (yay!!!!) and then disappears. Then it returns in the same spot for a second then disappears again. It wasn’t a drone. It was huge and suspended in the air perfectly like a hummingbird. I was super excited to witness this extraordinary event. Then more (military?) planes fly in and zigzag around the area of the unidentified other worldly lights. Later, while on the phone with Deborah I look out and see them again. I quickly ended the call and tried to video it but wasn’t successful before they disappeared again. Extraordinary. Then later still I was texting with a friend about this and she sends me news clippings of similar sightings in this area. Turns out Myrtle Beach is a UFO hotspot. Yay!!!! This video shows the blinking lights of the plane that flew in after the sighting, then a single UFO light appearing and then vanishing, and then reappearing and vanishing again at the end of video. — in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.",
"Cigar bright light in the sky, disappeared.  Every night this week a bright light has appeared in the sky by 7 p.m. and disappeared by 7:55 p.m. I originally thought this bright light was a planet at first appearance, but when it disappeared I question otherwise. Every night I went outside and this occurred between 11/29/21-12/2/21. Tonight, when I noticed that incredibly bright light disappear, I looked adjacent to where the light was and saw a cigar shaped light that I filmed for 7 seconds. It was there at least 10 seconds before I figured out how to use my camera and it disappeared as if it faded behind nonexistent clouds in the night sky.",
UFO highway trail  As I was driving I saw 3 lights in the sky just above the clouds not really thinking much of it until each one individually started to shut off. As I kept driving just over the bridge where the fox river runs at the corner of my eye I see a large object with 3 lights triangular shaped speed through sky in one direction from one end the river above the clouds to the other end heading towards Green Bay. Seconds after 3 more object each large in size with 3 triangular lights speed bolt following the first one in tight formation in the exact same direction as if it where following it one after another. It almost looked like you where sitting in your car driving at the same time and slowed down watching these object on a highway trail in the sky. Its like nothing I have ever seen in my entire life. I literally got chills when I saw these object go super fast in the sky because now I believe and not sure what the Fuc$ it was. This has forever changed my life and now I am not scared to say what I saw.,

"Line of lights, 50+ crafts, moving west to east. Seen directly south when we came outside, then as it was to our southeast, the line started to disappear from the front most craft to the rear. Can't upload photo from my phone to the drop box below, but I do have 2 photos",
"A stationary bright light that changed to blinking red/green on the corners before zipping away.  First there was a brilliant starburst shaped white light. I had no idea what I was looking at, couldn’t come up with any logical explanation. It appeared stationary but from my perspective it could have been moving toward me and I wouldn’t have been able to tell. Then all the light went out and was replaced by green blinking on the corners as it quickly zipped diagonally to the forward left (moving toward me) and then out of my eyeline. Which I know sounds like a plane but for how quickly it changed direction and moved across the sky in relation to how close it was to me and to the ground, I just don’t think it was. Too big to be a drone, it was silent so not a helicopter. Saw it out of my 3rd floor window at 6:06 AM EST, unobstructed view. It was higher than trees but not significantly. When it moved to the forward left it was probably within a mile radius of me, but I’m not an expert at gauging distance.",
"I saw craft exit portal/vortex  while fishing offshore I saw unusual rectangle shaped silver/gray cloud, then 2 teardrop shaped clouds dropped down from each bottom corner of rectangle. then vortex shaped cloud shot up from center top of rectangle cloud with star like object on top of vortex. vortex was spinning in clockwise motion. vortex remained, but object at top disappeared. then large cloud of vapor or mist erupted from the face of the rectangle for about 1 minuet. vapor stopped coming out of rectangle, but vapor remained in place. perceived movement in vortex from top to bottom. lasted several minuets. craft rode up thru vortex and about 150 to 200 feet above vortex. craft turned north, then west and then south southwest. portal disappeared, but vapor and the two teardrop shaped clouds remained. craft had arrowhead type appearance on nose, back part of craft cylinder shaped. about three fourths the length of 747. nose of craft morphed into same shape as rear so all was cylinder shape. bottom of portal never touched the ocean, and was about 50 to 75 feet above surface. after event ended I had a feeling of peace and calmness like nothing I ever felt. that night my teeth were very sensitive to hot (not spicy) food-first time that happened.",
"Observed a silvery object for 10 minutes about 8 miles SSE of my home, just E of the (LAS) Airport  4:15 pm 12/03/2021 while stand in the back yard with my neighbor, he points up in the sky and asks what is that? We live under the approach and departure area of the McCarran airport, I thought he was  referring to another type of aircraft. But this was no aircraft it was a long cylinder or cigar object bright white and silvery looking. The orientation of the Cylinder like object was vertical, the ends up and down  and it appeared to be hovering southeast of the airport. There had been air traffic departing in that area. I thought we would wait to see another aircraft pass by the area where the object was situated and gauge the size and altitude of it. But it seems at that moment all the aircraft that were departing had been diverted from that general area. There were two aircraft that had changed course and headed north east away from that area.  then all air traffic for 8 to 10 minutes seem to have been  stopped. About 10 minutes later an aircraft that looked like a C-20 in dark green paint was seen coming from the direction of the McCarran airport heading toward the object in the sky. The aircraft seem to have gotten about 1 mile from the object when it just winked out of sight. The aircraft passed through the area where the object was seen and continued on out of sight about 3 minutes later. I snapped a picture of it. Didn’t think it would come out because of the distance about 5 miles out. But when I enlarged the image I was surprised to see an image of a tic tac shaped UFO like the ones seen in the news recently. Image 1 is the actual photo taken , image 2 is an enlargement of 1, image 3 is an enlargement just after the the object vanished. Image 4 is map of area and approximate location of sightings.",
"We followed a bright white star and at closer range saw an unidentifiable hovering aircraft; it traveled far in the blink of an eye.  At approximately 4:30 in the evening, I went to my car to do some errands. I immediately noticed a very bright white point of light in the sky. It was much bigger and brighter than a star or a planet, but was not identifiable as an aircraft because it appeared to be completely stationary. I noticed it at dusk when there was still light in the sky (roughly in the same area of sky as I had, two months previously, seen a strange collection of lights moving in unison).  There was a second, smaller, less bright object as well that I noticed at the same time. I am still not sure whether this particular object was a planet or a phenomenon similar to the brighter one. It definitely was not a star, as it was too large and it did not twinkle. At the time when I saw both of these objects, no other stars or planets were visible in the sky, as there was still some daylight.  I was mostly interested in the brighter object, which I could not assign to any familiar category. I kept looking for it as I drove around completing my errands (admittedly, I was alert to strange phenomenon in the sky because of the unexplained objects I had witnessed two months prior). It was clearly visible from several places in town, but it was low enough in the sky that it couldn’t be seen from every location. It remained a very, very bright point of light, but when I saw it from certain angles it almost seemed to have a metallic gleam and I couldn't tell if it was completely spherical. It didn't twinkle (in the sense of periodically dimming) like a star, but at some moments its light seemed almost to pulsate with extra beams. It remained stationary the entire time I was out and appeared to still be in the same place when I arrived home in my usual parking space, but I noticed that it seemed actually to be slowly descending, as it was now partly obscured by the branches of the tree in my neighbor’s yard.  At that point, I got out of my car to take a video and pictures of the light to show my boyfriend (because he was very skeptical two months ago when I told him I saw a whole collection of UFOs outside!) The video wouldn't send, so I called him to tell him about it, beginning the conversation with the sentence, ""I think I'm looking at a UFO."" He spontaneously asked, ""Are you talking about that really, really bright star?"" It turns out he was on the Massachusetts Turnpike, heading toward Sturbridge, and he was also staring at it. He said the traffic had slowed and he suspected other drivers were slowing down just to look at it. He wasn't yet sold on it being too out-of-the-ordinary, suggesting maybe a planet had reached the closest point to earth in its orbit. But after he arrived home, as we stood outside staring up at it, he noted out loud that it was definitely not perfectly round, and he thought he saw two extra pieces coming out of it. (His eye are sharper than mine, so I’ll take his word for it, though I did agree it did not look perfectly spherical at certain angles. It is difficult to find words to describe or remember exactly the miniscule features of what was really just a large point of light, but it did at times seem as though light was reflecting off of it, and at times I think the shape could better be described as a knot than a dot.)  The two of us decided to drive around to see where we could get a better view. It had been an hour and a half since I first saw the very bright light, and it was still in roughly the same place in the sky, so there is no way it was any ordinary aircraft. As we drove around town, trying to see it better, we eventually turned down Mashapaug Road, which is very woodsy. (As we drove, straining to see it between the trees, I kept my eyes on the other light, the planet-or-UFO. It helped me estimate where in the sky I could find the abnormally bright light, which by now had descended much closer to the horizon.)  Finally, we came to a spot where we had a clear view. I think the clearing in the trees was due to a body of water but by now it was completely dark and hard to see landscape. But the light appeared closer now, as it was larger, and it now appeared bright yellow rather than white. As we followed the curve in the road I think we encircled the object, coming so close that we could see it almost right above us. From this angle, it appeared to be an actual saucer-shape with three rectangular lights. We both swearing and exclaiming; it was so surreal-looking! I said, ""It's shaped like a stereotypical flying saucer in a movie!"" My boyfriend said, “That is definitely not an airplane!” We both noted the three rectangular lights and the lack of any blinking lights such as you would see on most aircraft.  There was a row of cars behind us, maybe also trying to get a glimpse. We couldn't safely stop. We came to the gas station at the highway and turned around, but we couldn't see the bright levitating object in the woods anymore. We turned around again and onto the highway, and from there we could see the object in the sky behind us. We drove until we were able to reverse-course and keep driving towards the bizarre yellow light but it was so low on the horizon we kept losing it in the trees. At several points I noted the second, maybe-planet-maybe-UFO in the sky appeared to have the same knotty, not-quite spherical quality, and I said, “That has to be another one.”  At one point, I saw a bright streak, like a very fast shooting star, and when next we saw the light it had moved and was behind us. We turned again, still trying to follow it. At one point as were staring at it we noticed a car pulled over on an access road with a better view, watching it also. There were also a lot of normal airplanes in the air at this time, at least some of which we speculated were trying to keep an eye on it. We could easily distinguish our UFO from these craft because it was much brighter.  We lost sight of it again and when we saw it, far down the highway, low on the horizon, in the direction of New York, we decided it was too far away to keep chasing and went home - still searching the sky in case it came back or in case we saw another. It was gone from the sky when we parked. The brightest point in the sky now was what seemed to be an ordinary planet, and I couldn’t tell if this was the same maybe-planet-maybe-UFO that had accompanied the unnaturally-bright UFO. It was difficult to judge by memory how bright the second one had been compared to the normal heavenly bodies because I had only been approximating its brightness in comparison to the bright UFO. I had difficulty remembering its location for the same reason; I had been approximating its location based on its distance from the bright UFO, and now the bright UFO was gone. By this time it was approximately 8:30PM.  For background on the observers - I'm a historian who spends most of my time these days researching a book I'm writing on U.S. history and working online part-time. I'm also neurodivergent and used to being dismissed as weird. My boyfriend works in biotech and is usually not considered weird by anyone. He is pretty open-minded but definitely a scientist and needs to see proof before he'll believe in something as far-fetched as a mystery hovercraft outshining the stars. Now he's seen it for himself!",

"Cylinder or tic tac sited  I made a report on this sighting already. But I found a similar report from Downers Grove Illinois that occurred on the same date. Is it possible to contact this individual and show him my photos? He did make a request to compare information.. His report.

Was with my son in back yard, I looked up and noticed a very clear cylinder shaped object with looked like 5 white lights. I kept eyes on it and called my son to me, he was in a tree in yard shooting targets with bb gun. He came to me and asked ""what"" he could tell by tone of my voice it was something serious. I said ""what's that"" and pointed to object, he looked and his eyes got big, jaw dropped and said ""wtf is that"" I said something like I just wanted to make sure I was seeing what I was seeing. I asked him to tell me what he saw, to confirm to me what I was seeing. He said to hurry and take a picture, but didn't have phone on me and didn't want to miss at least seeing it for longer. After watching it for a minute, the object and a cloud next to it seemed to fade before our eyes not take off flying in any direction, which was also very weird. It was still light out and sky was perfectly clear and blue in area once object ""faded"" away, my son asked ""how did it do that"" like I would know. I been searching for a report of same thing before I said anything, when seen report from person in Elgin describing same thing but no lights I used that date, I know it was 1st week of Dec., was wanting to just confirm someone else's report. Being in a Chicago suburb and being very obvious in sky, I thought there would be many reports of this object.

Horizontal lights in the sky.  I came out of the house & saw what i thought was a meteor shower. When i realized it was not a meteor shower i called to my friend inside the house. We watched the lights hover across the sky for 3-5 mins. There was about 10 orange lights evenly spaced moving very slowly horizontally across the sky until they faded almost into what seemed like another dimension. Just before it disappeared i seen a white light shoot down from it tword the ground,
"It looked like a cigar shape tilted like a forward slash w/ 1000's of white lights moving in sync as if attached to something.  My husband called me to come downstairs and look at this thing outside. It was dusk so there was still a lot of light out, but the sun had just set. It looked like a cigar shape but tilted like a forward slash with 1000's of lights all over it (like you put on a Christmas tree not in a straight line just all over it). The lights were moving in perfect sync in the shape of a tilted cigar from right to left, not up, as if attached to something we could not see.  It was heading northeast. It looked like it was really really far away but, it took up a lot of the view as if it were humongous, as big as a city block but 100's of miles away.  I ran upstairs to look at it from the balcony and get a picture, but the iPhone wouldn't focus on the lights. It was heading northeast and I watched it for a few seconds and then it was gone. I still should have been able to see it, but it disappeared. We watched it for a total of about 2-4 minutes.",
"a string of approximately 20-30 lights moving slowly in a northerly direction  I stepped out onto my driveway at 5:40 PM and looked up in the night sky and saw towards the south what I first thought was a shooting star or a plane/ satellite breaking up. I continued to watch and realized the string of lights were not dissipating as you would expect with a meteor breaking up. Instead the string of lights continued to move in a northerly direction, eventually traveling nearly directly above me. The lights all appeared to be the same size but were spaced at irregular intervals and all were traveling at the same speed as if they were either flying in unison or were part of a single craft. They emitted no sound and were moving much slower than a regular aircraft. It was hard to gage the size or distance as I was looking up into darkness and had no other visual reference points. All the lights were the same color, a whitish glow. I tried filming with my iPhone but nothing shows up on the recordings. I did snap two photos. The lights passed over me, again moving at a constant speed in a northerly direction. They eventually faded from view, faster than I would have expected as they were so bright, almost like they disappeared in a fog. I would estimate the whole sighting lasted three minutes and the distance the lights traveled from the time I saw them to when they disappeared to be approximately 5-10 miles as the crow flies.",

Line of lights in the sky  A line of 30-100 lights appeared in the sky traveling in line. The lights were a bit dimmer of a commercial airplane. They were the samE color as the stars. They were moving North/Northeast. We watched them in the sky for a minute then they all disappeared. The line was not quite perfect some were a but higher or lower but pretty close to perfect.,
"Line of lights.  My husband saw a line of lights in the sky and ran in to get me. I ran out and also saw it. There were maybe 10-16 yellow/white lights with a gap in the middle in a diagonal line to the northeast of us. They looked close, and it looked BIG. It slowly moved across the sky and back away from us and then slowly up and back until it faded into the atmosphere. There was also an airplane to the north and it was way smaller than the thing we saw. We got a photo and short video of it on my husband’s phone, but the quality is not great as it was nighttime and his phone is just an XR. Still got some proof though! You have to turn the light all the way up on your phone or computer to see it in the video. My husband is a lineman for a powerline company and I am a stay at home mother. He was out just starting his motorcycle when he saw this and ran in to get me to look.",
"I stepped outside of my home,I looked up and in the south eastern part of the sky I saw a long line of lights. I asked my wife to come out to see it. She too agreed it was an unusual line. 15-20 lights,following each other. It lasted about 30 seconds. I tried to capture a picture with my cell phone,but it didn't work. Although we live close to the airport,this was not an air craft. The line seemed to be moving in a north eastern direction. If you look at a map of Maine,it appeared the line was going from Bangor Maine towards Bar Harbor Maine. Best way I can describe it. The best thing I can compare the lights to are the flares that leave the back of a fighter jet trying to avoid a missle. This lasted for about 20-30 seconds and disappeared with no noise,no flash nothing at all",
"linear, horizontal line of lights in the sky, traveling slowly; the line appeared approximately 20-30ft long from ground.

"Light in sky seen hovering rather low in the sky. Light was about 3-4 times the size of a large star. Looked odd.  It was around 5:30 pm. It was dusk but still light outside. As my son and I were pulling out of the Walmart and turning left onto Franklin rd, I noticed an oddly bright, low, and large “star” in the sky almost directly in front of us. I asked my son what he thought it was he said it could be a big star or planet. We both said it was still so bright outside to see a star and it was definitely too large for a star. I thought it was also very low in the sky. Our light changed and I said well it’s probably a planet or something and we made a right hand turn onto Franklin rd and ran another errand. About 40-45 minutes later we were finished. It was now completely dark and we were heading home driving down Bent mountain rd when we spotted it again. It was in the exact same spot but we were seeing it from the back side now. A different perspective from the first time we saw it. It was now a little more discernible. It was very bright in the sky and lower than any other “star”. I now noticed it was oddly shaped. It was circular but with possibly an appendage coming from the top left area. My son even said he thought something was coming out of it. It was now emitting a bluish green light from only the top left of the “craft” over the area where, what I thought was some kind of appendage. My son thought the appendage was just light glare. The bottom of the “craft” was emitting white light. I could now tell it had a shape, meaning I could discern it was a 3 dimensional circular object. Not just a light in the sky. It appeared to be a craft of some type. I cannot say how high in the sky it was, other than to say it was about 4x the size of a large bright star. My son thought it maybe moved a little but I thought it was stationary. It was difficult to tell because we were driving about 45 mph on a fairly winding rd. I’m certain it never moved. We viewed it almost the entire drive down bent mountain rd. I was driving so I only was able to look at it for a few seconds then turn my eyes back to the road. It was in view in the neighborhood of about 4 minutes. We lost sight of it once we got closer to 12 O’clock Knob rd. We made our right hand turn on that rd and then a left onto Lost Mountain rd. I was hoping we would be able to see it again once we arrived at our house but we couldn’t from our elevation. We live in a Mountain area surrounded by trees. Anyway, there were a lot of people on the road and I can’t imagine we were the only people to notice it. One other thing that may be helpful. We live about 30 min from Roanoke airport and we saw an airplane in the vicinity of the object.",

White dots moving in a line.  I came home and parked my car. As I circled behind my car I looked at the stars to the north.  I noticed what looked like 3 stars in a row but they were moving slowly to the east. A fourth dot appeared behind them and traveled in the same path.  As the first dot started fading a fifth appeared.  There were 4-6 visible at any given time. I called my wife out to make sure I wasn't just seeing things and she confirmed that it looked very abnormal and they were moving in a line then would fade out after traveling for 10-15 seconds. We tried to take pictures or videos but our phones could not pick them up. After about two minutes the lead dots started fading and no more appeared.  I watched the sky for a few more minutes and they didn't return.,
6-8 lights moving in circular pattern from west to south along the sky  Saw 6-8 lights the were equal in brightness to the stars. The lights were steady and did not blink like the normal air traffic in the area.   They were observed south west of Ashburn VA. They were equidistant from each other and appeared to move in a circular pattern from west to the south.   As they continued south they were no longer visible. They moved at a moderate speed similar to that of an airplane keeping equal space from each other the whole time,
"Small lights circulating in a straight line, over and over  As I was walking the dog, I looked up to follow the path of an airliner flying west. As the airplane crossed the sky, out of the corner of my eye I noticed starlike dots, flying rather close to each other and in a northwest direction. I could see 4 lights trailing each other. As the lead dot disappeared a new dot appeared at the end of the formation and this continued for about 4 minutes. There were no flashing lights, only starlike dots moving in order, over and over again until they finally stopped. I called my wife outside and she also saw what I saw. Then, nothing.",
My sister her husband and I were viewing the stars last night. At first we thought we were seeing the starlink satellites but they were very far up in the atmosphere. They were sometimes in parallel rows and not in a straight line. They would appear at a certain point and disappear around another point. This went on for over 15 minutes. The sky suddenly became hazy in their flight path. We stayed out quite late but the sky didnt clear back up. Its very concerning because there were so many of them for so long. Where were they going?,
"Hundres of white lights traveling in the same direction and same speed west to east over Chisholm mn , there was a pattern ( ***   **   ***   **   ) like that moving along the night sky. Pictures were taken and video was unsuccessful.",
Ball of fire.  1/8 th inch from my perspective.  No light trail.  Looks like landed in Gulf of Mexico.  Did not look like shooting star.  Much closer and bigger.,
Circle of light going around in a circle in the sky.,
blue light crash.  cube space craft with yellow lights  i first saw a big ship with yellow lights behind  it looked bigger than a normal airplane when it was distanced i  saw a blue light zip down right before my eyes and landed somewhere nearby waite park i’m guessing,
"Rectangular craft with thin black strip in the center. Drifting in a northeasterly direction.  It was early in the morning just before sunrise, approximately 4:50am on May 9th 2021. I was outside in my backyard checking to see if I could spot smoke from an out-of-control forest fire that was in the area. While I was outside I saw a large craft slowly drift overhead, without making a sound. It drifted in a northeast direction, and I'm not sure how high it was but I got a excellent view of the object. To me it looked like a satellite that was very close up. It was a thin rectangular shape with a black strip down the middle, and the arms/wings glowed yellow, like it was reflecting sunlight. I don't know if it had it's own light source or whether the light was reflected from the rising sun. I watched it for around 30 seconds and then I thought I would run in the house and grab a camera. I was in the house for about a minute and when I went back outside the object was gone. At the speed that it was drifting I thought I would be able to go inside and grab the camera and still be able to get the picture, but it was gone.",
"Flat all black almost like felt material coming toward road I was on. I thought it was a medical helicopter landing for a car accident, then it turned and kinda looked like a hang glider but it was so black i could not make out a good shape. I opened my window to listen for sound and there was none. I pulled car over and began to take video. It moved in many direction and then went straight up until i could not see it.  It was the size of a small helicopter, kinda of liked like a giant black batman, but more of a craft. Daylight busy road. Hovered over the Hudson River for about 5 mins.",
"A silent disk went over me, my fiance and my son's head and out over the water of Clear Lake. It was mostly a sphere but a narrow band was around it. It was brightly metallic but had dark shadows on it. There was only one. It went over our heads and across the water, disappearing into the distance. It was moving fast, but I got a good look at it. It was fast, made no sound and it moved with kind of this weird wobble, kind of gently tilting. As it was directly over the water, there was a puff of white cloud or smoke around it which dissipated quickly then it moved very fast and I couldn't see it any more because it was moving into the distance. Even though I saw the saucer clearly over me, it moved fast. when I saw it moving into the distance, eventually it appeared as a single white dot. It seemed to bother the ducks. I am an artist. I can draw this.",
Small bright whight light  i seeing the sky every day in my home from 2016 because any things comming to earth like ufo but i cannt seen till 2020 and after 2021 i watching the any object crossing i saw one circle like object slowly moving that was bright white light its just few second and i watching daily it go fast in sky and some time slow some time go off quickly straight line in sky when its comes for me comes to know about that thing i can feel also and now that was showing in history tv skinwalker ranch,
"Zooming ball of light in the Hawaiian night sky defying all propulsion physics.  On a beach stroll at night with my significant other. Her and I noticed a star like circular dot way up high, no different than any other lit star or planet in the night sky. However, the the dot of light began to move at a rapid pace. It had the ability to go the full distance of the sky in mere seconds. This was no shooting star for it did not quickly vanish nor was it a low altitude airplane like craft. We could barely make out the shape before it cut short immediately, lowered slowly at a 90 degree rate and disappeared behind some clouds. I went back out each night hoping to see something similar. And on 5/12 I saw a ""star"" making similar movements but this time it was much closer to the ground. It was changing direction and getting closer almost as if it noticed me. My neck began to hurt from stargazing so I had to give up and go back inside. But as I kept looking back over my shoulder on my way back, the light became brighter and it felt as i! f it almost was following me home.",
Flying line Formation of unidentifiable objects in clear sky  Myself and my wife were taking a nighttime stroll. She directs my attention to an unusual formation or constellation of stars. I looked up in the direction which was north on my compass. There were about 9 stars very far away appearing to be like distant stars but they were in a perfect line. Then we realized they were moving. Almost too fast to be normal. A plane doesn’t travel across sky that far at that speed. They also were moving out of site they were flying over head and the sky was perfectly clear so it’s unexplainable how they were flying out of view unless they were flying further in trajectory. Nighttime flights can’t be in a straight line which also makes me wonder if this was one object that was Massive.,
"My home security camera captured two spheres of light hovering around. It appeared as if they were aware of each other. Then the biggest sphere released a much smaller sphere, and all 3 appeared to hover in respect to each other.",
"I just returned from walking my dog when I turned to the NW and saw what I thought were 3 stars, but then noticed one was moving, then noticed all 3 were actually moving...I watched as more and more moved into my view from behind the trees before disappearing behind the trees on the other side...I watched for about a minute, of coarse thinking I was nuts, but then called out my 20 year daughter who also saw them...We then watched for about 2 more minutes before the stopped...We tried to video them but the lights were too far to catch on video...I have the videos but nothing can be seen...The were moving in a straight line, one after the other, but not in uniform distance from each other...Some were closer to each other, some further...Does anything happen with this report? Thanks!",
"Orange Light Over Mobile AL  On Mother's Day 2021 , An orange object caught my attention at 23:30 while I was sitting outside. It was orange and bigger than the average star . The object was moving through the sky freely  . Also it had no sound of an aircraft . My cousin and I saw it once it disappeared and left us in disbelief. Shortly It came back zapping across the sky again flashing and teleporting . We tried to face time and call others outside to see but it disappeared into the sky.",
UFO sighting  This is the second time I’ve seen UFOs flying in sky. This time it was two UFOs flying steadily & slowly in southern direction. First time I saw the object it was flying fast & smooth.,
"I was driving home, headed southbound on Bayshore Blvd. approaching Gandy Blvd. driving 35mph.  Approximately 6 or 7 streets north of Gandy, I witnessed three bright yellow circles or spheres shoot overhead, in formation.  It caught my eyes as they moved like a fighter jet descending toward a landing strip in the distance.  At first I didnt think anything of it since MacDill airforce base is located a few miles south from Gandy, in the direction I was headed.  But the speed of these aircraft was much faster than when you see a plane flying overhead.  Because of the oak trees that line Bayshore Blvd, my view was blocked for the next few streets until I turned onto Gandy.  I really was interested to see the aircraft again, but there was nothing in the sky anywhere.  I doubt these were military aircraft but I thought important to report this sighting of something that I suspect was UFO.  I hope this is helpful.",
"Various UFO's photographed May 10, 2021 from a United Airlines airplane between St. Petersburg and Sarasota FL.  Last May 10th at 12:17 pm while on a United Airlines flight from Chicago somewhere between St. Petersburg and Sarasota, I took photos of some picturesque cloud formations with my Galaxy S21 Ultra camera that has a state-of-the-art camera. The plane had started it’s descent and was flying at cloud level. A week Later when started looking at the photos, I noticed a tiny white oval Tic-Tac shaped objects along-side the engine of the plane, and another just above it. They looked exactly like the Tic-Tacs the Navy pilots recorded that was released to the media several months ago. As I viewed each photo carefully, I found several Tic-Tacs, and others with oblong shapes that were gray or silverish color. The last photo was at 12:37. By that time the plane must have traveled 20-30 miles.  It wasn’t a reflection from the plane’s interior since my phone was pressed against the window. Besides, the ovals in other pictures are seen at different quadrants of the photo frame. If it was from the interior, the ovals would always be in exactly the same place in each photo. Some photos had multiple ovals, or cylindrical shaped objects. Was it a reflection from the ground? I don’t think so because of the various locations in each picture, and the fact that the plane probably traveled 20-30 miles during that time. So if it was a ground reflection that would have to have travel the path of the airplane. Plus, many of the images were next to clouds. I don’t think clouds reflect images from the ground; otherwise, planes would constantly be flying through a mishmash of images reflected on the clouds. Some images were alone in the sky. There is a quick sequence of pictures (not enclosed) taken in relatively the same ground area, and each shows the progression of the ovals moving faster than the plane.  I never noticed them when taking the pictures because they were small, I was focused on framing the clouds, and they must have been going faster than the plane. I was able to record these because the camera was set to auto, and since it was pointed at the bright sky, the meta-data on the JPEGs indicates the shutter speeds were from 1/1600 to 1/2000. This may explain why I was able to capture and freeze the image without too much blur; although after enlarging some of the pics, some images did show blurry movement.  Enclosed is only a selection of photos. These are some of the highlights. I have many more. The only Photoshop alterations are on some of the JPEGS to crop and enlarge the images, and on a few of the oblong crafts where I tried to sharpen the image to possibly get some detail. If you are interested, I will supply you with all of the photos.",
"Metallic tic tac appears hovering over the water and moves off silently on a sunny summer day  Sitting on a dock, waiting for boats to come in and sell their products, I continuously scan the horizon.  I do my best to see the boats coming from a distance so I can have everything ready when they pull up.  This particular nice sunny summer day as I scanned from left to right nothing was there.  When I scanned back right to left, I saw a 60' metallic tic tac shaped object hovering 20-30' off the water.  Once I layed eyes on the object it moved from right to left slowly and silently until it went out of view behind an island.  No wings, no sound, no idea what it could have been or how it appeared in front of me.",
"I saw a roundish, kind of out of focus white sphere, that eventually disappeared before my eyes.  I had dropped a friend at the Indianapolis airport and was driving back to my home in Watson, IL. I was traveling west on Interstate 70 and was approaching Terre Haute, Indiana. I suddenly noticed a white, roundish object in the sky ahead. It was almost like it was out of focus because it didn't seem clear. I was wearing sunglasses, so I quickly took them off because I thought I would be able to see it better. It actually made it less clear though. My sunglasses were polarized so for whatever reason, the polarization of the glasses made it clearer. I put them back on and watched the object for maybe 30 seconds or so as I drove. It wasn't clear to me though, almost like it was hazy or out of focus or something. As I was watching it, it suddenly blinked out of existence!! I put the time I saw it at 6pm, but it could've been anywhere between 5-7pm. I can't remember exactly when I dropped my friend at the airport, but it was definitely in the evening before it got dark or even before the sun was noticeably going down.",
Line of stars exceeding 25 moving slowly  While flying across egypt we recognized a strange phenomenon looking like a line of stars exceeding 20 It was slow moving in equally separated distance for almost 5 minutes till it passed above us.  I was able to take a photo of this strange phenomenon.,
String of lights  Saw a string of fast moving lights that disappeared in the sky. There were about 25 to 30 traveling towards the south and up. Looked like a string of tracer shots but there were no exercises that I knew of going on.,
"2 orange stationary pulsating spheres; then 5 smaller orange spheres moving irratically not pulsating with no sound  On May 11, 2021 at 10:00 pm, I stepped out on my back porch for a second. I looked up and over the two story house facing west behind mine because something caught my eye. I saw two pulsating, glowing orange stationary spheres, one a bit lower than the other, as if they were floating. I watched for about fifteen seconds and then looked away to call my husband to come immediately. When I looked back they were gone. They made no sound at all. When my husband got outside I told him what I had seen. We waited about eight minutes and they reappeared again, but they were across Hwy 701 South and there were five of the orange spheres. One of these spheres then darted from right to left towards another one at a very high rate of speed and stopped just as quickly without touching the other sphere. On a clock the movement would have been from two to eight o'clock. No sound. Not pulsating or stationary and then disappeared. Within minutes a low flying plane flew over w! ith bright white landing lights on heading west to east towards Myrtle Beach International Airport. FAA tower supervisor was not able to tell me if any radio traffic confirmed my sighting. Will file a freedom of information application with the FAA. This occurred near a power company solar farm and high voltage power lines.",
Many people in town has reported about 2 circles glowing redi-sh orange. The one was bigger than the other and the like pulsating. Witnesses have posted videos on facebook.,
Dark spots in the night are UFO.s  Me and the children watched this blinking flying object fly east then it stopped moved a little to the right and then left. Then it went down and looked as it it were docked on another object. All these objects are in the sky usually in the clouds. You can visually see them because the objects are black. They are darker than the night sky is.,
"I noticed the unidentified bright lights and vertically aligned squared shaped objects moving sporadically as seen on the security cam.  At 5:03 am, I checked our security cams, and, for the first several seconds of clicking on our security cam 1, the security system kept saying the system is busy and unable to record when I clicked ""armed"" or record. My husband and I received a series of notifications (thru the security cam app we use) regarding motions detected, but he seemed to be ignoring them though. I checked the security cam 1 and viewed it live. It seemed like something was interfering with it. I shared the live cam with my husband, but he said they were spider webs. Below is one of the video clips that I saved on my phone. More than 4 bright lights/or light reflections started moving sporadically later in the recordings, while 3 of them, shaped like small squares, were vertically aligned at the top left of the video. I think the video below was recorded at 5:25 am. I stopped the recording at about 5:45 am, and those unidentified sporadic bright lights were still hovering ne! ar or by the security cam 1. I'm assuming this event lasted about an hour, because at around 6 am, the sun generally starts to rise. I also noticed in one of the recorded clips, a bunch of raccoons were running across the other side of the street towards where the dumpster is and away from our driveway.",
"Metallic white almond shaped object  with bright blue aura in dense woodland  I was on the back exterior of my home and noticed a blue, almost aqua colored light coming from this oval like object resting slightly above ground in the woodland behind my house. In attempt to walk back towards the aura I was met with an unusual sensation almost as if i could no longer inhale the air around me due to it being so dense. when approaching this object i noticed how the exterior of it was a bright white metallic like substance. On the sides of this i could make out large square orifices that seemed to have a reflective material over the top of them that produced this bright blue light. as I approached further the object seemed to lift off the ground with no contact from the brush or damage to any trees surrounding the area, it raised from its previous position and almost hovered in the opposite direction with no noticeable sound,  the lights on this craft began to flash and then shut off permanently.",
"single small disc like a helium balloon but flying overhead straight, steady, silent and fast just after sunset. No wind.  Saw it in western sky about 35 degrees, thought it was a helium party balloon, but noticed it wasn't tumbling, but floating steadily eastward. It passed directly over my head and the building behind me cut off my field of vision as I turned around to watch it. It had no lights, but a whitish oval patch on the belly. There was no wind at ground level. As it passed overhead I was sure it could not be a balloon. It flew straight, silent and steady. It looked as though it was headed in a straight line directly over the town center. I'd be surprised if no one else saw it.  Size: like a dime or nickel held at arm's length. Very clear and well defined.",
"Object was photographed, but not seen at the time the photo was taken.  May 12, 2021, my girlfriend photographed a rainbow with an iPhone 10 in three consecutive photos (1 – 3). The last photograph (3.) captured a white oval shaped object.  I have included the photos with their descriptions.  Photo Information: 1. First photo is of the rainbow, zoomed in. 2. Second photo is of the rainbow, zoomed out. 3. Third photo is of the rainbow, again zoomed in, but this time however the photo caught an oval shaped object at the top center of the image, which was not seen by the photographer at the time the photo was taken. It was seen only a couple of days later when I examined the photos. 4. This is simply an enlargement of the oval shape with no adjustment to the color or contrast. It is interesting by the fact that it looks as if there is disturbance in the air above and around the object. 5. The contrast is boosted in this image, as well I increased the DPI to reduce the pixelization to smooth it out. When I did this, I was expecting to see simply a white shape getting whiter. What really struck me were the colors that were hidden in the bleached-out whiteness of object in the original state. 6. This photo has the contrast pushed almost to the maximum.  I have no idea what this is, and I have never seen this kind of shape appearing in an iPhone 10 image before, assuming it could be a glitch in the picture.  Assuming it is not a glitch, but an actual object, if I were to interpret the colors in photos 4, 5 And 6, I would say the first photo captured an object as it is falling, leaving a sort of wake in the air above it. 5 Looks like the bottom part of the object is heated up while the top is cooler. 6 is that concept visually enhanced.  If there is further interest in this, I have the original, raw photos with the original metadata which I would be happy to share with you at your request.  Thank you. David",
"Just before sunset, an aircraft with three bright white lights hovered over the highway treeline observing traffic.  There were three white lights, shape was unclear from our angle, it was resting up and to the left of us in the clouds and did not move. When I saw it at first I thought it was an airplane flying way too low but then I noticed it wasn’t moving. I fumbled for about thirty seconds to get my camera on record and about ten seconds into the recording it just slowly vanished like it went stealth. It didn’t move the entire time, no towers around, no flights landing at the small airport nearby because we passed it shortly after and there were no additional planes on the parking strip. I caught a video of the unidentified aircraft, myself and two children witnessed it. There were about 5 or 6 other cars in the road but I don’t know if they saw it as well.",

As we were walking, we all saw a large, round, blueish-green object in the sky.  as it got closer to the ground, we could hear nothing and the size did not get smaller.  The object appeared to land or crash, because we never saw it go back up.  We also stood there shocked and talked about no noise on impact, if it did land.   As we continued to walk and discus this, we heard a noise, it turned out to be another player, on our team running up to us.  He said he saw it and was freaked out about it.   We talked about it to our coach and other players and they just laughed at us, dismissing the whole thing.   To this day I recall the whole episode and even remember, where I was as I stiull live in the neighborhood.

"A luminous green orb object over London  I am an investigator for the Post Office and, about late March or early April 2000 at between 0630-0645 hours, I was driving to work in South London.  The sky was still dark although you could see that the sky was getting lighter. From a North Westerly direction I saw what I thought was a shooting star. Traveling from East to West.  The object was an aluminous green in colour with a slight haze around the edge, no tail and orb shaped. From my perspective it was about the size of a grape.  It just disapeared over the horizon.  The sighting only lasted for a few seconds.  I have not mentioned this before as I have only just come on line.  It may be nothing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is unknown.  PD))",

"I saw a round glowing orb on the road from Lake Arrowhead down toward San Bernardino.  Earlier this week I heard Peter Davenport on Art Bell's program and heard the woman who saw the object near Lake Arrowhead.  I didn't hear a lot of what she said because there was a lot of static.  It reminded me of a situation that happened to me about 2 years ago in the same area.    I left Lake Arrowhead and I was heading down the mountain.  When I got on Highway 18 I saw this round glowing object nearby on the lefthand side of the road.  At first I thought it was the moon and I remember thinking that it was so pretty and so close.  Then, and I'm embarrassed to say this, I realized that it wasn't the moon because I was heading west not east.  This object kept pace with me and it was playing games and taunting me at the same time.   When I speeded up to get a better look it moved away but still kept the same distance between us.  Then I realized I was witnessing something quite interesting and certainly not a normal occurence.  It was rather large too.  The next weekend I went back to Lake Arrowhead.  I went into the Stater Brothers market to talk to Sharon who worked in the bakery department because I wanted to tell her about my experience with the object.  She got this knowing smile and said, ""Oh you saw it"".  I said ""yes"" and asked her what it is.  She said these glowing objects/balls come up along the road.  (I must say if you have never driven Highway 18 it is very winding and there is the mountain on one side and the valley below.  It is a very spectacular sight from this road).  So they come up along the valley side of the road.  She said that these objects appear to selected people, they are friendly, and they are communicating with us telepathically, teaching us and warning us. She said they appear quite regularly to selected people.  Anyway, I thought this might help you to piece together a pattern because I know there have been quite a few sightings near Lake Arrowhead, Running Springs and Crestline.",

It's because of these implants that i can hear see and feel in this game that they are playing on me.  They use sound projectorery so i can hear in the game, graphic projectorery so i can see stuff in the game.  Heck they even projected sound in me and my dad's phone before.  I did talk to them before too. But it was not the real ones on the phone my dad herd them too.  But again they was using sound projectorery. I know how to hear the real ones.  But i will tell u these aliens is in the 4th dimension.  And how i know also i got implants is i can take a magnet on my back and can feel the magnet work on these implants.  I got at least 4 on my back and i need your help on! geting x-ray cat scans MRI. because i know u know alot about implants and how to pick them up.

As they made their last loop i got the binoculars, and as quickly as I saw it, it was gone   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",
It was cigar shaped approx 75 to 100 ft long  silver in color no external fins  altitude around 10 thousand feet  clear sky and daylight   no sound and moving from Northeast to southwest direction at a pretty fast speed 100 miles a hour plus .   Jets cross our house all day long  so going by them for speed we are on approach to dulles air port,
"Man sized blk circle w/ antennae down each side, single white light.  Obj hovered over field, backed behind some trees and vanished  I saw this on my way to the schoolbus one morning. I was in the 1st or 2nd grade.  I lived on Lower Roswell Rd. in Marietta, Ga - which was a fairly rural suburb of Atlanta in '74 -  on a 2 acre tract of land bordered by a neighboring field, and about 2-300 yds beyond a recently built neighborhood subdivision called Kings Cove.  The nearest cross street is(was) Dickerson Rd.  I was walking southwesterly toward the bus stop across my yard when this object caught my attention, roughly 45 degrees off my left shoulder hovering silently over my neighbor's field.  It was a black, round, man sized object, featureless except for a single light in the middle of the circle, and two ""legs"" which were thin, antennae-like hanging down from each side of the circle.  About the time I became cognizant of what I was seeing the light in the middle of the circle went out.  It then backed silently and smoothly backward and upward, across my neighbor's field and positioned itself behind the pine trees which bordered this field and the back of the subdivision.  The object then vanished.",
"observed a darkred,almost purple,blimp shaped object with a belt of panel-like windows that might have been like bluish lights in them,laterally and circumferentially,located around the middle of the craft.It moved slow like a blimp and was quiet.It moved slowly for a minute or two and suddenly accelerated so quickly that it appeared to just vanish.  I walked out the frontdoor of my home to my car to go to work at approximately 0800 hours.I was facing the east.The weather was sunny but with just a few light,scattered clouds.The clouds were no hindrance to visibility.As I proceeded to my car,I looked up to the north-northeast sky and observed a large,purple object (one only) that sent cold chills down my spine.It appeared to be moving very slowly over the southeastern corner of Lake Hefner in a southerly direction and then turning to the southeast.The speed was similar to the speed of a blimp.The altitude was less than 1000 feet.It appeared to be at a distance of approximately no more than 1 to 2 miles.It was completely silent.I was in a state of disbelief or denial about what it might be.I was trying in my mind to tell myself it was something manmade.I also knew for certain that it was not an airplane as I am familiar with the physics of airplane flight due to the type of work I do and who I work for.It would have stalled out as big and slow as it was moving.Next I tryed to tell myself it was a blimp,but I am familiar with say,the GOODYEAR blimp,and it was not that due to the coloring.It had bluish looking panels going around the craft in the middle laterally.They appeared to be flashing to a degree.I wondered if it might be some sort of advertising device on a blimp.I told myself it was very odd looking but beautiful for a blimp.It was very strange because that was the only lights on it.No beacon lights(red,white,or green) were observed that a normal craft would have.As I was observing it`s motion,I yelled for my wife to come outside,which she did.I pointed it out to her and she also saw it,along with my granddaughter,who also observed it.I said ""keep an eye on it and I will run back in the house to get a camera"".I did this but could not find the camera.This took no more than 30 seconds.I ran back outside and it had disappeared.I asked,""Where did it go?"" My wife said it accelerated so fast it appeared to just disappear.We asked ourselves what coul! d it have been.The complete time of the event was no more than 2 minutes.First,it was definitely not a plane.The HARRIER jet is the only plane I know of that could move like that and it was not in the shape of a plane.Secondly,if it was a blimp,how could it just disappear like that?? I have watched blimps land or accelerate and it takes a little more time to accomplish than the 30 seconds I was in the house.I listened to the radio and checked the newspapers and never heard anyone else report this event.I am at a loss to know what we observed!My background is:Machinist for the U.S.AIRFORCE for 28 years and 53 years old.My wife is a clerk for the OKLAHOMA ((deleted)) and 2 years younger than me.My granddaighter is 8 years old.I dont use any type of alcohol or drugs, nor anyone else in my family.I can report that we all were very sober for this occurrence.I regret not having the date of this event nor any photos of the craft.Also I wished I could have reported the event sooner.I hope that by telling of this occurrence to someone who knows something of UFO`s that it will help me to purge my mind of the frequent question I ask myself:""What did we see?"" and I hope that maybe someone may have seen something similar to this somewhere.If you are able to help,I would be very grateful!",
"Cigar shaped object flew over my parents home in Pendleton, Oregon  About 2 years ago during the summer I was visiting my mom in Pendleton, Oregon (I live in Stanfield about 22 miles from Pendleton), and we (my family) saw these two lights one in front one in back. At first I thought it was just two planes.  My brother pointed out that they were flying in perfect alignment and so we waited to see if when it flew over the stars, if it covered the stars, which it did.  I did not go in to get a camera or anything because I was in shock and afraid I would miss something.  Anyway, it flew along then suddenly shot out a flair or something then it was gone. I called the airport tower which told me that their last flight was well earlier.  I called the National Guard Base who told me they had no flights out at that time.  I drove to the airport to look for incoming planes, and I did see some 20-something people out by the hangers, so maybe it was two small planes, but it made no noise, and samll planes usually make a lot of noise, and it did cover the stars. The object seemed to be cigar shaped with a light on each end. All the neighbors were out, but no one was looking up and no one else in Pendleton ever reported a thing.",
"There was about 8 balls of bright light when suddenly it started to change and it formed a triangle.  I was at my home with my mother and my brother. I decided to go outside to look at the sky when I saw about 8 balls of bright Green light that then turned to white light. After three minutes the line of  balls started to move and they formed a triangle. I runded inside to tell my mother to come out.  When she came out the balls where gone.  She tought that I was crazy and that I was just Imagening UFO'S becuse when I was little I started to be interested in UFO'S.  After almost a week I saw the same thing again, but it did not last that much time.  I know that I am not crazy.  After seeing the report of channel 13 about the Seattle reporting center I decided to get on the internet but my computer didnt work so I used the schools computer to contact.",
"I spotted an intensely white bobbing teardrop shapped light in the NE sky on a clear August morning in 1976.  Facing NE into the a clear, cloudless, blue morning sky I sighted a teardrop shaped intensely white light.  The shape was totally devoid of any color.  It hovered over the parking lot in which I was standing and observing.  It seems to bounce vertically. It did not appear to have any solid form, as an object, but was merely a light in a general teardrop shape, or an upside-down candle flame, pointed at the bottom.  I felt that there was something spiritual and serene about the ""thing."" I never reported the event at the time, nor since, but have always wondered about it.  An astrology amateur told me in 1997 that he calculated that the object was likely an early morning sighting of the planet Venus which would have been in the northeast sky on that date. It seems like a possible conclusion, however, my skepticism lies in that it did not resemble at all what I might think of as a planet.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

"It's difficult to explain this one off, but I've always been curious having read so much of other people's experiences. Plus, we were all memebers of the military at the time of the incident, which kind of set off a series of events afterwards. We were hanging out behind the barracks in which we lived, on a somewhat famous military base in the area mentioned above. I would first mention that neither of us had consumed any alcohol or anything else that would have impaired our sensabilities.  One of us, I can't remember who, had spotted a dull looking object behind where we were standing (I'm unsure of the direction from which the craft approached). The craft had to be a quarter mile long and half the size in width! Now the starnge part, the craft was almost like a Star Trek shaped vehicle, only it was tubular in frame configuration, and had two similar sections front and rear. The rear section,again, attatched by tubular material to the front section, clearly sat higher in elevation than the front section. As the craft passed over us, it made no sound whatsoever, not even a wisp of traveling through the air. And the most peculiar thing was that there were no lights on this craft at all. I've always wondered about some of those strories I've read where these craft have a ""Fourth of July"" display of lighting. considering these craft are real, which I do believe they are, why would they need to display something greater than say an anti-collision light on a normal aircraft. Rarely have I ever read of a similar experience. The remaing two strange things are, I can hardly remember the names of the people I was stationed with of which I had the experience, and, the craft glided over a ""Major"" Army base! We couldn't have been the only one's to have seen this. I hope that sometime in this lifetime I read something similar. I know we seen it, I know it was a physical thing in the air! And the fact that I also noted right angle type objects, and some kind of lines of some kind along the sides of the craft. Clearly man made(or something else)!

"Orbs in a cluster formation, orange, split apart, vanished  Late at night at a friends house. In the backyard, alone, facing southeast. Looked up and saw some very strange-looking orange orbs, or lights, high in the sky above the trees and far away (not sure how far). There were at least six, and some of them split apart to form more. The objects were very bright, and were clustered together in a kind of formation. No blinking. No sounds. They moved in slow, random looping motions and the lights gave a trailing effect. The display struck me as very unearthly. It did not last long, perhaps between 5 and 10 seconds. Then, all at once, the objects disappeared like someone flicked a switch, and the formation was gone.",

The third light to join was moving erratically amongst the other two in a somewhat horizontal pattern. Once stablish the top right (top right in the formation) started flashing, as if it was signaling the other lights. After a few flashes the first light flew off, above (I think) the mountain range and disappeared. Then the light started flashing in a different sequence (seemed like the flashes slowed down) and seemed to be signaling to the bottom light, which then proceeded to fall towards the ground. (Keep in mind, these lights were above the mountain range to start) while the second light was falling it was falling IN FRONT of the mountain, you can see the light rotating while it’s moving towards the ground, Before it disappeared into nothingness..

I was kind of far away from the window so the passing object was only in sight for maybe half a second.

"Bright light hovered above city for 2+ hours. Thought it may be a planet, but clouds moved behind it and it looked much closer.  My partner leaves for work around 4am most mornings. I moved to the living room and noticed the light shining through our big window was much too bright to be the average plane in the SDF flight path. Having been here a year, I have seen many planes on the SDF flight path go into and out if the city. This didn’t look quite like that. It had a large halo, almost like the ring that the moon gets on a misty night. The clouds were visible and moving behind the light. I checked my sky tracker to be sure it wasn’t a planet. It was not a planet. I chalked it up to being a plane, but it sat still for way too long to make sense as a plane, I went back to sleep after taking a few photos and it continuing to not move in the sky, but was unable to figure out what it was.

"Circular object hovering above farm fields by my house. I go inside to tell partner and had disappeared when I went back outside.  One evening in early February at 5:47pm I went outside so my dog could do her business and I looked up at the moon which was above my house. I then noticed what looked like a planet in the sky near the moon, over some farm fields by my house. However, it was too early to be able to see a planet. It was small, circular and light in color. It did not move when I was looking at it. I took photos and video of it, then went inside to tell my partner. He looked out the window and confirmed I wasn’t seeing things. Still in the house, I opened my SkyView app to make sure it wasn’t a planet and indeed it was not. It’s also too large at that distance to be a drone or at least a civilian drone. I went back outside and it was gone, but I took more photos / video of where it had been for documentation. All of this was within a four minute span.  I zoomed into the photos I had taken and adjusted the brightness and exposure and it’s somewhat triangular in shape with rounded corners and seems to be illuminated (perhaps from sun reflection or lights on it?). Also, it has what looks to be an aura / haze around it?! I wish I had kept my eyes on it the entire time to see what happened to it! I’m going to attach the evidence I got.  Now I’m supposed to give some personal background. I previously worked at a fast paced job in NYC as a manager in analytics consulting. We had a sighting in NYC as well; two smaller wobbling flying saucers going down the street between buildings by our apartment! My partner saw them through binoculars and I saw them with my own eyes. I will post that encounter under New York State sightings. Anyway, we moved back home to Utah and once we had kids we didn’t want a nanny so I chose to stay at home to be the primary caretaker and I don’t regret it. I find the paranormal interesting. However, I am a skeptic and try to debunk something before believing it. I’m a spiritual person but consider myself agnostic - I believe in something higher than us, just not sure anyone can say what it is.  What I saw is a head scratcher for sure. Skinwalker Ranch is a couple of hours away and what I saw looks exactly like what they’ve seen over the ranch multiple times if you’ve seen the show.",

UFO?  He text me this:  I text my buddy in latrobe and showed him.. he said his buddies were already telling him about it. The wife and I felt uneasy.. It wasn't anything we've ever seen and the pic really doesn't justify what we actually saw. It was early.. we watched for a straight hr.. I don't think its from here,
"Round metallic craft, silent, no lights  My daughter and I spotted a round metallic craft above us at 6:25 on 2/9/22.  The object made no noise and had no lights.",
"Fire orange ball appeared &shot across and disappeared  A fire orange ball out of nowhere appeared. From the ground, it was the size of a quarter. It shot across the sky , what looked from the ground to be about 1 foot. So fast , no plane flies that fast. Then just disappeared. No sound . It was a clear sky with white stars no clouds",
"Red and green lights hid the actual shape of craft  Was walking dog when he suddenly startled and ran the length of 8ft lead jerking him backwards. He and I both looked up and I heard an extremely loud ""whooshing"" sound and sped off in a sloping upward pattern and then sat absolutely still for over a minute and I actually got nervous and went for cover. I went to my apartment and grabbed my phone and proceeded to balcony and it had gone behind a building for short period and then for roughly 15 minutes I was able to video tape 3 decent clips. The concerning thing is that this object was not a run of the mill drone. It was very large in size. This object had green and red lights. These lights were on the underbody and flashed.",
"2 Orange UFOs, one with horizontal lights and light beams  We were sitting on the porch outside and one of us notices a bright orange object and says ""What is that?"" and the other of us turns around. We see an orange object with 4 horizontal circular lights, one turning off, then each one turning on and off in sequence, right to left, directly above the ocean water. Each time the individual light turned on, a triangular beam emitted directly below the circular light and disappeared when the light when out. After the 4 light/beam sequence, the object disappeared. A moment after, another orange object appears further in the distance, and the first object we saw reappears down the beach and the same 4 light/beam sequence happens again. Both objects disappear after the 4 light/beam sequence.",
"Saw a metallic 1 foot thick disc hovering in the street. It made a loud noise, projected light onto the street  I was awaken approximately at 1 AM by a sound which I mistook for a very loud car or street sweeper of some sort. My room faces the street in front of my house, giving me a good view of passing cars and anything else out there. Also parked in my front yard is a run-down Chevy S10 pickup truck, I will explain why this is relevant later.  When I opened the curtains, I saw a 20 foot diameter 1 foot to 15 inch thick polished steel disc hovering in place in the street. The object had solid edges, flat like the rims of a coin, and in the bottom center of the object was a large bright light. It was projecting a beam of some sort down onto the street, which I could see was stirring up leaves and branches, causing some sort of wind to whip up.  My pet rabbit was also reacting to this, running around my room in a fit of panic, thumping and grunting unhappily. I'm assuming the sound the object made was disturbing her so. It was a deep, low hum, not unlike that of an electric transformer, and I could feel it resonate in my entire body. I don't claim to know how the next thing happened, or why, but the nearest I can describe it is... The object communicated with me telepathically. I could perceive spoken words, exact spoken words, as follows:  ""It's okay. We're not going to hurt you, we're just taking some measurements. We will be gone soon.""  I remember feeling an odd sense of calmness despite seeing what was essentially a UFO in the street outside my house. I'm an aerospace and engineering enthusiast, but I'm no UFO nut, and while I have seen some strange aircraft in my time, I have never seen anything like this before or since. Nor do I believe in telepathy, mind control or any new-age stuff. Never the less, I could ""feel"" the UAP attempting to communicate a sense of safety to me. Evidently it worked, because rather than being startled like I normally would be, I scoffed in annoyance at the loud noise, covered my ears and went back to sleep.  I woke up the next morning with my hands clasped firmly to my ears.  I don't claim to know what I saw, but I saw some weird stuff. Moreover, the Chevy s10 pickup in the front yard, which has a broken tarped-over window on it, had had its tarp blown away by something. It had also been pelted with various objects, possibly pebbles and small stones, as the left side of the truck was scratched and dinged up when it hadn't been so a day earlier.  All I know is that I'm tired of this X-files Roswell crap, and I'd love some answers.",

"When it was dark I Saw 2 aliens one time and many UFO's in sky everyday for 4 days that seemed to be looking for something.  I saw what appeared to be two aliens one morning and several UFO’s for four days. February 9, 2022 around 4:30 am I saw two aliens/creatures. I was walking my dogs when I saw a very bright, yellow saucer that sparkled like a firework sparkler. I quickly scurried into the trailer where I was staying to get my phone so I could take pictures. I left my dogs inside. I took pictures and started walking inside when I heard some rustling in the tree. I looked and saw an alien/creature peeking over the top of trailer at me. It kept bobbing up and down looking at me from the roof. It kept bobbing up and down until I waved and said hello, I’m not going to hurt you. After I said that it stopped bobbing and just stared at me for 20 seconds or less. I saw it from the waist up. It was dressed what looked like a costume that was silver and purple. It looked like it had black hair but it might have not been hair but part of the costume. It had all black eyes that were huge. After it disappeared, the wind started blowing really hard but only in the area where the alien was. Then I looked down and saw a silhouette standing there looking at me about 8-10 feet off the ground that had legs and arms that was similar to a human. The head was huge and not the same shape as a human. When it saw that I saw it the wind started to blow even harder and it ran toward the laundry room. I didn’t see where it went after that because I was scared because I sensed it was scared. I went inside at that time and attempted talking to it threw the trailer. I mentioned I wasn’t going to hurt it and I wanted to talk and be friends. In addition, I stressed for it not to take me. I came back out where I saw it the first time. It was still there peeking at me over the trailer occasionally bobbing its head up and down. I waved again and said I won’t hurt you. It disappeared and I went inside again saying the same thing to it. About half an hour to an hour, I stood at the trailer doorway. The bright yellow saucer had moved almost above the trailer. I looked over to the left and saw what appeared to be an alien/creature. I only saw the head which looked like it was wearing a silver and purple helmet. It was right behind a bright light that was on top of the laundry room. I believe it thought the light would be too bright for me to see it. When I saw it, I looked away at the saucer then looked back but it was gone. I looked back at the saucer and back where it was and it was there staring at me not moving. It disappeared after I looked away and looked back a couple of times. That was my only encounters with an alien/creature. When it turned light outside, I went to see if I saw anything. I barely saw the yellow saucer. I could barely see it because It moved way up in the sky. I didn’t see anything until dark. That’s when a lot of UFO’s came out. They were flying around all over. They looked all different from each other. The lights that were on them made their shape. Most of them were shaped like a saucer and the others didn’t really make a shape. There were all different sizes and all of them had different lights. Some had all yellow or white lights, some had different colors, and some had lights that blinked. None of them appeared the same. One major thing that really stuck out to me is it seemed they were looking for something or someone. My thought is one of them are missing. The next night there were even more. This time there were some that formed a line right next to the bright yellow one I saw the first day. There were some also circling around by themselves. I recognized there were no airplanes going out or out of all airports. I have an app that shows a map of all aircrafts in the area. There were only about 5 Phoenix airplanes and they were at the Phoenix airport. All planes were gone from the little airports. There were 5-6 helicopters flying around which there is usually only one flying around. Until February 13th there was always many UFO’s flying at night only. Sunday the 13th is when they opened the Phoenix airport for night flying and the next day the little airports were allowed to fly and have their planes at the airport. What made me decided that for sure I saw actual UFO’s and not airplanes is they would move up and down quickly and they never made noise. They look very similar to street lights and other aircrafts and can easily been mistaken for aircrafts. Since the 13th I’ve seen the yellow saucer one time and two UFO’s that had very few white lights and red blinking lights. As they flew over me they made no noise.",
"Followed by short moving contrail  Bright unmoving light; at first light small contrail moved fairly quickly across sky, heading south",
I worked 3rd shift when I came home it was there  I've seen it the 1st time on February the 9th and again on the 12th and everyday sentence the very 1st photo I took if you scroll around on the photo you will end up seeing about 12 different UFO's everyone I have shown the pictures too says that I need to report it is the only reason why I'm doing this You can scroll down on the picture And you can tell that this is not an airplane airplane or anything like that it just sits there makes no sound,
"It blinks randomly and the blink stops sometimes and it goes back to the left and right trying to hide in trees sometimes  It shows up at 1 AM when everyone in my house is asleep, and it shows up at the same spot sometime it changes position where ever I go it also makes me scared of it I do not know if the UFO is making me scared, or it's just me having bad anxiety since this sense has been happening for 2 years, and it is getting annoying, and it makes a sound like a plane, but that could be something else in my house and I checked a plane tracker and there are no planes or helicopters in my area  ALSO, NO PHONE NUMBER only email I entered a random number, so do not call it",
I have video of a alien & photo & lights flying through my house  I saw an alien looking in my window the alien left an imprint on the outside of my window in which I took a picture of I also have the picture of an alien in another window on a video and a picture of it I also have live a video of why it’s beaming through my laundry room coming from the sky or through the ceiling,
"This interactive object was bright sphere shape with an aura that could change speeds, stop, hover, expand, retract, and shoot light.  I was driving home from work. It was 6:00 a.m. on Wed Feb 9th. I first noticed this object at the intersection of Trillium Boulevard and County Line Road. Initially, it appeared as a very bright white sphere that could change speeds, stop and hover. As I continued to drive home I could see it the entire way keeping pace with me as I traveled north on US 41. It was east of the road I was traveling on. I had a pretty good view but there were some tree lines in the way, so once I got to my road that I live on, I stopped my car and I had a very clear view of this object. At first I thought it was probably a drone so I took out my phone and I decided to video it and take some pictures What occurred during that video is what made me believe that it might not be a drone. The object in the sky shot beams of light towards me and it expanded and retracted in size multiple times. I have this on video. At that point I got a little freaked out and immediately continued home. The object seemed to follow me and hover due east of my home pretty high up. I ran inside and got my wife and she saw it as well. At this point it appeared as I originally saw it in a bright white sphere. As the sunrise came on and darkness began to fade it disappeared.",
"Driving on freeway and a reflection caught my eye towards the airport and seen it was not a airplane  Around 2:50 pm I was driving north on on interstate 10 freeway and right before my exit on palm drive, a reflection object caught my eye from my left side towards the mountains over looking palm springs. At first I thought a airplane since the palm springs airport is right on the base lane of that area but then I quickly realized it was too small for a airplane and it was moving slowing up the mountain side since it was already 3/4 from the top. I kept looking and noticed the object had no reflection due to the shade of the mountain but still moving slowly up the side. At the same time airplanes where taking off and banking right from the area of this object. I got the off exit palm Dr and pulled into a gas station and tried to find the object again. From there I spotted the object hovering above the ridge line. And at this moment of writing incident I can see the object. I will try to record since object still there around 3:04pm. Object was then seen gone and no video taken.",
"Several glowing orb lights in random formation above Hwy 80 in Emeryville  Wednesday evening, February 9th, I was driving near the Chevys parking lot on the Emeryville Pier and saw what I thought were lights attached to the construction cranes hanging over Hwy 80 (several exits were under repair at the time). However, as I stared at them, I realized it was something different and pulled my car over immediately to get out and take a look. What I saw were 5 softly glowing, silent orange lights in a random formation over the highway. Each light was slowly pulsating. It seemed as if they were just hovering there, but it also seemed like they were moving towards the Oakland Hills. The formation was random; a couple of them seemed quite near the highway.  I drove my car over to the end of the pier, by the boats, to see if I could watch them further. By the time I got there, the lights were already closer to or directly above the Oakland Hills. I watched a couple of them sink behind the hills and the rest drift further east into the fog, where they disappeared. I kept watching, and noticed either 2 additional glowing orbs or the same 2 orbs that floated behind the hills earlier float back up from behind the hills before following the rest into the distance. I thought I saw one more as I went to my car, but I can't be sure. I couldn't take my eyes off the sky for a little while longer and just watched and watched, to make sure I didn't miss anything.  This took place over the course of a half an hour, at night. I've lived in Oakland for years and I tend to watch the sky at night from my porch, so I have a good sense of the various lights that appear regularly in the night skies (e.g., helicopters, drones, airplanes). The site was strange enough for me to pull over, and then keep watching as long as I could. It gave me an eery feeling.  The only explanations I can think of are flares and paper lanterns, perhaps released from somewhere near or on the pier. The latter seems more likely, given the direction they all seemed to be going. It's conceivable that there was a group of people further down the pier or on one of the boats releasing paper lanterns.",

"Clear blue sky. It was following a jet that had just taken off from PHL airport.  I was looking North/East. Round silver disk was following a jet that had just taking off from PHL airport. It was probably a quarter mile behind the jet. The jet was northbound, moving from my right to the left. It followed the jet for a few miles, then it suddenly dropped straight down, then disappeared. There were no lights, the sun was reflecting off of it. Very much in focus. It's size was a quarter of the jet. Then, for whatever reason, my eyes were drawn to the North, where I saw 2 more of the same disk following another jet heading West, they were 2 fingers apart. Then 'they' stopped and started moving in the opposite direction towards the North/East. One moved in a straight course, while the other moved erratically in all directions, keeping close to the other one. They were moving at a moderate speed. I followed them for 2 hand widths until they disappeared behind a tree. Mind you, I am 68, I do not drink, nor do drugs. I did not imagine these craft. You may contact me if you wish. Thanks.",
"Diamond, hard to visualize, low hum but other person didn’t hear it. Got right above us and moved very fast. Ex military, moved strange  I was walking with someone I was having a conversation with. They stopped at their vehicle, and I was semi waiting for them. Just over the top of the truck, something passed above us. Friend in the truck didnt hear anything and I even called to him once, to which he didn’t respond.  It was shaped almost like a kite. The middle was black. There was “something going on” because it was blocking out the sky behind it, and it was so close I knew there was detail there, but my brain literally could make sense of it. I I also couldn’t tell if I was looking at it from its side or it’s belly. Like my eyes wanted to make it be flat, but it didn’t know how.  There was 3 lights, that looked like they could be regular ass lights. But there was like a “creamy” hue to them. I DID HEAR A HUM THOUGH, I know so frequently ufos are reported as silent. However the hum was very unsettling. It sounded like a broken subwoofer, only I could just barely hear it.  So now I’m yelling for this guy I’m with to look. He comes over and he sees it flying away from us. It seemed to emit s pinkish hue and We determined it’s flying like \ . He also can’t make sense of it. It was fast. He didn’t hear it, nor me asking him like a crazy person to come look at it. But that seemed to shake him a bit more considered how gosh darn low it was.",
"Visited back yard once, Showed up in every picture, as I was photographing the moon.  1st time- Was meandering around my back 40. As I walked out of my shed, it noticed me. It stopped moving COMPLETELY. It made itself ""glow"" more dimly. Then, tilted it's front towards me, froze for 1/2 a second, and turned around slowly. The damn thing slowly flew upward at an angle. Then, DISAPPEARED, gone. Leaving a TINY TINY cloud of smoke/maybe dust? It made absolutely no noise whatsoever! None.  2nd time- I was photographing the moon. I noticed a blue ring making a rough pentagon shape in the sky. Looked later, it's in every picture. Hours later, the window in my office, lit up brighter blue than any blue I've seen. No noise.",
"Bright light moving quickly, then stops for 30 seconds. Began to move closer (see pics)  Bright star like obeject moving quickly with rotating lights. Entities attached to what appears to be a large circle of light.",
seen it from a distance it came closer did not look like any aircraft I ever seen wasn’t flying fast was close yet no sound  Flew from south east heading north east I seen it from a distance it was reallly bright. Much brighter Than any aircraft.For 30 seconds or so my view is obstructed. When I came in to view it was probably only quarter mile away low-flying with absolutely no sound a Rectangle like about this big is it commercial jet airliner and then behind it two more lights and some type of a part of aircraft I don’t know I have a picture of it. I don’t know what it was but it was not like anything I’ve ever seen In the light coming from what look like part of an aircraft to the large rectangle Light in the front you can see clearly on the picture camera sucks it’s an iPhone 8 but when you look at it you’re going to agree with me I wish I took video Countless airplanes in the sky here going to Burbank And Van Nuys Airport. End it was flying in the Path of Burbank Airport I believe :you see a lot of planes! But usually a Little bit higher.I wasn’t even going to report it im not a big believer in space ships lol but it was so odd can’t stop thinking about it people laugh when you show them the grainy pic but if you were there with me you would agree this was an odd craft and NO SOUND that’s what gets me?,
from my position to south west.  Object was staying still but i think rotating itself. Most probably it was satellite but i'm not sure. Because it is changing itself. It was shining like a brite star. And i took shots from my apartment.,
In a cloud above my home  I took a pic of the clouds above my home. I didn’t see the UFO until I looked at the pic later that day.,
"Saw it briefly two times in frame taking pictures then looked back over pics and realized I capt. it tried recreating it with no luck  It was a beautifully clear day on the way back from Vegas. I was flying Spirit Airlines. I was sitting on the left hand side of the aircraft and was looking what would of been NW? I took many many pictures on the way back of all the lakes and snow packs and mountains and deserts. It was closer to WA when we were above a floor of clouds it was breathtaking. The sky was brilliant blue. We came to an area where there were breaks in the floor of clouds which looked like lakes so I was snapping shots. I also notice there was a jet trail in the far distance. I was zoomed in on that area and I noticed a disk like object coming into the frame and then almost vanishing like it was going behind a cloud. I thought nothing of it. A few minutes later I scrolled back through my photos and that's when I had noticed that I caught it in a frame. I zoomed in and was perplexed as to what it could be. I tried recreating the object in pictures afterwards thinking that it could of been a piece of dust on the window or something, but I could not recreate the object at all. I later zoomed in and it was even more bizarre. IT was a silverish disk like object with rings on the bottom of it.",
UFO in clouds  Took a pic of clouds over my home. I didn’t see the UFO until I went back and looked at my pics I took that afternoon.  I also noticed my watched stopped working at that time.,
"A sttange object with three wings took flight from ground level and disappeared into a northern direction upwards.  I saw an object take off from ground level, quite far from me. At first I thought it was a passenger jet, since it was taking off from the vicinity of George airport, as seen from my point of view. I kept looking, as I was intrigued by the sharp angle upwards of the flight path.  We were watching the sunset from our balcony while I witnessed the aircraft gaining height. After a few moments, the flight path seemed totally strange and I pointed it out to my parents and my wife.  My father fetched his binoculars. The object changed his direction from flying westwards towards Hartenbos, to flying in a northern direction.  We all got a chance to have a look at the object through the binoculars. It had three wings around its main body, comparable to a rocket with three wings evenly around it. The whole aircraft was unmistakably rotating while it was flying further upwards. All four persons present saw the constant rotation of the object. The craft was yellow and shining in the light of the sunset. It kept getting smaller and smaller as it gained height in a northern direction until it was too small to observe. The whole sighting was more than ten minutes long. There was no sound audible.",
"Large glowing yellow round star shape floating and moving above the beach and shore.  Last month I stayed on the same stretch of beach at an ocean front beach house. I was sitting on the deck and saw this weird ‘star?’ but I noticed it moving closer to me and then back toward the pier. It would hover in certain places. I could not tell how big it was but all of a sudden the yellow star took off super fast toward the south and disappeared in seconds. So now, one month later I am on the deck at a different oceanfront beach house on the same stretch of beach at about 8:30pm and I see the light coming up the beach toward me, heading North. I recognized it immediately. It stopped about half way between me and the pier, hovering. Then all of a sudden it like heated up and cast a dimmed light onto the ocean near the shore and then took off super fast heading upwards. I followed the red dot as far as the eye could see and it took a right turn and disappeared. The light cast on the ocean told me that it was pretty big. Anyway, I am freaking out and am like damn, I did not have my camera. So I hung out again hoping it would come back so I could get video. It did not, but I was freaking out that if it did it might see me trying to capture it from the light the camera emits. I can’t believe I missed that opportunity. I have seen ufo's before in NM and a triad in St. Louis, Mo many years ago but this might be the closest I have come to an alien abduction (nervous laugh.)",

I found it laying on the ground of my old place that I was renting a room from. It's green, has a brush like texture on one side.

"Grey Spheres flying fast, and low above city, appearing out of nowhere and disappearing into nothing.  My fiancé and I stepped outside our business for a cigarette. We run an exotic animal rescue and actually live in the back, there is an apartment. We were talking and I was looking at the sky, the next I thing I see is 5 grey, metallic looking spheres flying very low above our business and off into the distance disappearing. When the spheres first appeared they where in an uneven triangle formation then all switched positions, some overlapping others( looked higher up in the sky). The whole event only look seconds and my fiancé saw a large flash in the sky afterward. I’ve gone through a few options of what they could such as drones or helicopter, they made absolutely no noise and it was extra quiet when they went by. They didn’t have any lights, and I got a clear shot from how low some dropped to when they split from the triangle formation. Some of our animals have been acting spooked, or even just on edge since the incident occurred. Which is odd because we have no windows in our unit, so they wouldn’t be able to see anything anyways. Sometimes you can tell if it’s man made, or even the government…this time I have no idea what I even saw, hence my reason for this report.",
"Saw bright dot lights come down in front of our apartment and then go back up. y  My wife and I were watching Ron's Gone Wrong on HBO MAX. We were sitting in front of our living room window facing the window. As we watched the movie we noticed these bright lights that were a perfect circle ""turn on"" but like they were coming down. Think of like a beam of light but in dots. They were a perfect circle. No glare or anything. They came down and then went back up. As it They went back up if looked like they were being turned off. One after thee other. When it got to the top we could see or sense the unknown object leave via the right side of the window. Not fast or like any known flying object, say a plane or helicopter or drone. Tonight has been very very stormy and windy which confused us. Because it would be a plane or drone or helicopter. We both saw these strange dot lights and didn't say anything until after we saw it leave. Then we turned to each other and asked if we saw that. I explained to my wife what I saw and she verified she saw the same thing. The whole experience took around 5-8 seconds. We live on the 3rd floor of apartments. There is a small open field across from our apartments. So the top of the lights had to be way above in the sky and the bottom had to be across the small field to what seemd like the ground. Behind the field there are other apartments. The lights didn't stop behind the apartments which means they were in front of them by the field. We both sat there trying to find explanation to what we saw but remembering how stormy it was also helped verify it wasn't normal. We both felt woth blank minds. Like shock perhaps or like we couldn't believe what we saw. It wasn't normal. It would have been the starlink satellites because the lights came down. It wasn't across the sky.  My wife thinks it was as if it was an object that came down turning on the lights but I feel as it was a beam of light in form of dots. We both feel like we could see the object leave slowly as if it's floating or hovering via the right side of the window.  Please contact me via email as i do not answer unknowned numbers.",
"I was sitting up in bed on the upper floor of my house  I was sitting up in bed just having used the toilet, turned off the light and folded my iPad away and put it down on the table next to my bed when two lights extremely bright came on at the same time illuminating the whole room, I would say they were just behind the tree line (trees not very high, they had to be fairly low as my sight of vision put these lights in the centre of the window). These were perfectly still for about two seconds. In a split second they went out but from my side window I saw a flash of light disappear to the right from my side window at phenomenal speed. The lights must have stayed bright as they shot off as they kind of faded smaller as they went into the distance seemingly heading over the small village of South Brent in the Dartmoor direction. The speed they went off was mind boggling. I have never seen anything move so fast and there was no noise whatsoever, total silence, as the window was open. I use a fan at night to keep the air fresh so as to help me sleep.  No 1/ when the lights came on there was two lights, perfectly in line, set apart, extremely bright and focused not like the sun where the light spreads out, this light was tight and whitish blue in colour, extremely bright. White on the inside, blue aura around it. No 2/ the lights appeared to go out but I don’t think they did, I believe they appeared to go out due to the speed of travel which seemed instantaneous like 0- to whatever. I believe this to be the case as the illumination I saw from the right window faded very fast as it disappeared toward the Dartmoor direction. What I am describing was at an unbelievable speed. Oh, and on shooting off there seemed to be a somewhat slight orange tint to the lights on disappearing to the right through the second window.  I am not a person who lightly reports things, I did not consume any alcohol last night, I just felt a need to report this as someone else may have seen this in the same region or area. That’s all. I am 65 years of age. My email address refers to a Gibson guitar not a ufo. I admit I am interested in this phenomena but I have never witnessed anything like this before. And I don’t believe it was a natural event. I must admit it felt eerie.",
"Saw a bright blue light three times, each one getting closer and brighter, and heard ""wom wom"" when the light flashed.  The blue/green light flashed three times. The first time was further away and I was reading, so I didn't know quite what it was. The second time it happened, it was closer. The third time, the light filled my whole bedroom. Heard a “wom wom” for the second two times. There's nothing in my neighborhood that could've produced this sort of light or noise.",
"Saw what looked like chemtrails but couldn’t have been because they were so short, and facing downwards, and had a light inside of them  Couldn’t have been a chemtrail. It was two of them and they were too short to have been chemtrails. Stayed way too long, almost my entire drive home. Seemed like I was getting closer then would seem way off again. Could’ve been something cigar shaped, tilted downwards, two of them. Saw lights in the front, facing downward. Normally chem trails are going up or just horizontally, and you’d think the direction it were going up, would have had lights on it, not the other way around. Almost looked like something hurling TOWARDS the area. Weird.",

I was headed home from work, on the phone with my mother, and I noticed a large black cigar shaped object in the sky, it had a very subtle curve to it, not a completely straight cylinder almost like a very long parachute or such item but without anything hanging from it. I kept eyes on it's general location all the way to my apartment parking lot, I continued to observe it from the parking lot for a few minutes. I think the full amount of time I had eyes on it was 15-20 min because that's about how long it takes for me to drive home from work. The object was in roughly the same area throughout my observation, although it may have been moving it is hard to tell as the bulk of my visual on it was while I was in a moving vehicle.",
Saw bright object that sun was reflecting from in sky and then dissapeared  Was driving home and saw something bright in the sky that caught my attention thought it was a plane but then noticed it wasn’t and it looked like the bean in Chicago downtown sort of and as the light turned green I thought I can drive and see it and what it was but then it disssapeared like if the object had camouflaged itself,
Saw it in the sky and realized it was moving.  Just happened to spot it.,
"Two large cylindrical ships, one above the other with colored lights like moving Christmas lights. They remained stationary.  I left my parents house on Elm Hill around 7:30 to walk down the hill to my apartment. At the end of their driveway, I happened to look up (due west) and saw two large seemingly stationary objects with colored lights along the bottom. The lights on the top one made one blinking pass like Christmas lights. I observed them for maybe a minute or so. When I continued down the hill, they were still there. When I got home, I couldn’t sleep for most of the night thinking about what I saw. They were definitely not airplanes. They made no noise and did not change shape or size as long as I observed them. I now wish I would have observed them longer, but it was really cold out!",
"I was taking a walk down by the river on my property when I became fixated on the horizon in a strange trance like manner. I saw an incredible shining silver disc that had an ""aura"" enveloping it. It moved gracefully across the sky slowly rotating and shifting from a disc to a cylindrical shape and then back again. It was incredibly bright but at the same time, it did not hurt my eyes. I stood still and time seemed to slow down, everything became extremely quiet. It slowly moved across the horizon while I followed it I noticed to the left of it three bright red lights in the shape of a Triforce shoot into the sky and disappear. I felt an incredible sense of peace and well-being and even waved at the craft as if to greet it. After a while I had this compelling sense to head back to my house to grab my expensive camera for a higher quality picture. When I returned the craft was gone, instead there was a strange black jet hovering around in a strange flight pattern as if it were following the craft (or knew when it manifested itself?).",
"Husband and kids tobogganing saw a whole bunch of little lights that looked like stars but they were moving  Tobogganing saw many little lights but bigger than a star, moving all around in the skies. Appearing and disappearing. Never seen anything like it before.",
UFOs travel nightly over my property and house. Usually it’s quiet and I only see because I’m looking outside.  I have a photo of one craft that I captured on camera as it was hovering over my house.,
I saw something hovering over my house and something with a bright light  I have multiple pictures and videos of something on top of my house. It looks like a square hoverboard and it's on top of my house something is riding it and there is another figure standing next to it.,
"11 silver/Yellow balls of Flames Headed Up  I was buying a last minute anniversary present after work and I saw strange firery lights in the sky. The lights were yellow but almost silver or metallic. Didn’t have a definitive shape. Flickered like fire. I have no idea what they were but it’s got to count as a ufo. I’ve checked news reports, found no explanation. I was alone. My wife thinks I’m just tired and overworked. I don’t want to tell other people who will judge me. I know what I saw",
"Dark disk like object in the sky.  It was right around noon, clear sky’s and I just happened to look up to notice that the normal air traffic in the area started to change very quickly! Airplanes flying lower to the ground then normal, then helicopters maybe 4 stories off the ground. Then I noticed higher up two jet’s flying in formation side by side and at first glimpse I didn’t notice but then i saw a darker disk like object just a head of the jets. It stayed in sight for 20 to 30 seconds and all of a sudden took a hard 90 degree turn straight up and disappeared within a second. Not much longer afterwards a few Blackhawk helicopters was circling the area this went on for a few hours.",
"Slower meteor-like object, but made turns  I saw an object high in the sky, that I thought was a slow moving meteor entering the atmosphere moving from the NW of my position toward the S-SE. It’s speed was roughly 1/4 that of a meteor. About halfway through my field of view, the object’s speed seemed to decrease, and then, the object turned toward the west, slowed further, and the turned back toward it’s original course, and traveled out of my view. That the object turned was a surprise, and is the reason I’m writing this report.  I initially thought it was a meteor, as it started as a faint light, but, the object’s brightness increased, as though it was heating up. The color of the light was not white-hot like a meteor, but, more yellow, and the light was not from a sharp point, but rather seemed to have a haze around it. I did not notice any trail of smoke or debris following it. As it traveled, the brightness did not seem to fade significantly like a meteor does as it disintegrates.  Very probably, there is a simple explanation, such as a guided missile test, but, I’ve not seen nor heard of one in this area. Nor do I know where to find information thereof.",
Bright white object right shot across sky and disappeared in front of me  I was driving down 64 almost to Lexington. The sun was just coming up over the horizon. A bright white light caught my eye above. I look up to see this bright light dart from my left to in front of me very fast and then just disappear right in front of me. I don’t think this could have been a shooting star or plane. I’ve never seen anything move so fast and then just gone. If didn’t disappear behind a mountain or into the sun or anything like that. I had my music on and it happened so fast I don’t know if there was any sound.,
"Saw a bunch of what looked like stars moving fast  My boyfriend and I were looking at the stars when he pointed out that a star or light had been moving but kind of fast. I then saw 3 move the opposite direction with one actually popping up out of nowhere and it was like the light went on, started moving then vanished again. Then what I had thought to be orions belt (pretty easy to see with the three lined up stars and it looked like the full constellation actually. We then saw the orions belt constellation moving fast to the right in the direction of ewa beach. By fast I mean it was noticable that it was moving from one side to another. It seemed to move fast yet slow enough to not be alarming. They all looked like the stars meaning small dots in the sky.",

Recorded in back yard  I submitted pictures but didn’t realize my sister had a video. At .54 seconds it appears to be a tic tac shaped object crosses the screen. Not sure what the rings are but I noticed the contrails at first and that is why I took a video,
I actually took a photo of the crescent moon and didn’t notice the ufo until later  I did not sight them until later in the photo,
"5 bright white lights, similar to spot lights, appeared one after another and then faded away. All at different elevations.  While driving southbound on route AZ 77, in the south eastern sky, near the upper corner of my windshield 5 lights appeared, glowing from light to very bright and then fading away within 10 seconds. They appeared in random order and elevation in the sky and appeared in a row or cluster. A few minutes after they disappeared a strange electronic type buzz rang out inside the vehicle, yet nothing could have caused such an event.",
2 large bright objects hoovering over Toronto January 4th 2022  I do not have photos but video. I noticed alot of air traffic from my balcony last night and decided to take a video. One minute after recording I noticed two large bright objects to the North and South of the CN tower. One of the objects disintegrates in the video the second object gets very low before diappearing below the cityline and over the lake.,
Bright ball of light moved in an odd pattern.  Bright ball of light that moved left then right at an average speed then straight down really fast and disappeared behind the tree line. Was straight ahead of me while I was driving. It seemed to be at some distance.  I’ve seen shooting stars before and this was not a shooting star.,

"Bright cylinder/oval shaped object quickly zipped through sky and disappeared  I was in my backyard with my dog and looked up because it was a clear sky. I saw a brightly lit, slightly oval/cylindrical object high in the sky that appeared quickly, zipped to my right (NE, I think) and disappeared. It didn't seem to go far before it disappeared. I'm sure it wasn't a comet; there was no tail of any type. It just started at one spot, flew very fast and disappeared.",
"2 diamond craft moving slowly thru the sky  While walking my dog, I noticed a diamond shaped object in the sky. It could not have been more then a couple of thousand feet in the air. As the object moved closer, I could see that the object had 2 diamond shapes. One in back of the other. The 2nd diamond shape was slightly elevated above the first. There were 2 separate objects. Going from a NW direction to an an easterly direction. The 2nd object trailed the first object by about 15 seconds. The color of the lead diamond was bright white with three lights on the top (either side), and two lights on bottom (either side). Both craft were blinking. The sighting lasted about 10 minutes, as where I was standing I have a clear view from my house to the mountains about about 3 miles away.",
"me and siblings were at park when i spotted strange craft that looked hundreds of feet long and had lights going down it  at 5:42 pm on december 3rd at pavilion park in irvine, me and my 2 little siblings and 2 kids playing at the basketball court next to us saw a strange long craft that looked hundreds of feet long. It was skinny and had lights going all the way down it. It was moving quite slow, and it took about 5 to 10 minutes to fully pass the area of view. I have video footage.",
giant straight line of lights moving slowly then disappeared  We were getting out of the car and gathering our groceries. I look up and there is a giant straight line of lights moving super slow. After a minute or so they faded out and disappeared. The lights were above farm lands and could not have been from any other objects.,
2 golden orbs flying across sky  2 golden orbs flying side by side across the sky from west to east.,
"Long cylinderical craft with about 15 or 20 white lights or windows. Moving quietly from West to East.  Two observers witnessed the sighting on 03 Dec 2021 at 6:09pm. Observer #1 (Female 64) has a master’s degree in Orthodontics. Observer #2 (Male 59) has an engineering degree with aerospace, automotive and medical device experience.  Both observers witnessed the same sighting: one large, long, cylindrical craft with multiple (approximately 15) large white lights evenly spaced along the length of the craft. The sighting lasted approximately 20 seconds as the craft quietly (no sound whatsoever) moved from the west to the east. The outline of the craft could not be seen in the dark sky but the lights seemed to have a radial shape and were symmetrical. It is possible the lights were windows of a craft that was very brightly lit on the inside. It is difficult to assess the size, height and speed due to the darkness. A best educated guess is the craft is approximately 200 feet long, 12 feet diameter, a height of 500 feet to 1,000 feet and moving at 80 to 100 mph.",
"Saw a series of lights hung about 1000 or so feet above on the right hand side of me  Driving home from a hunting trip on escambia river to pensacola i saw a series of perfectly level lights hanging maybe a thousand feet above the ground. At first I thought they were stars, but then noticed they were moving spatially with the car and they were much too close to be stars. I remained looking at them for about 4 or 5 minutes until they were no longer visible behind the curvature of the road. The elderly gentleman with me was looking at the road as he was towing a boat and refused to look over. I tried to get a picture but they were too far away; I was able to catch a brief glimpse on video nothing is really visible.",
"Looking straight up into the sky before 6:24 PM on December 3 we noticed lights in a tall and thin formation built of 20 tictac shapes.  Three adults and a few children we’re looking straight up 20 miles east of the Austin airport when they noticed from the west to the east that this very tall sand connection of 20 TicTac shaped building structure like a skyscraper or a long row of lights. It appeared that these objects were flying in synchronicity together or possibly connected in an extremely and abnormal quick way. There were no sounds, and no propulsion smoke. The adults had to look straight up to see it. An airplane was much lower in the background leaving Austin in a south-southeast direction.",
"Saw the object while in flight  During helicopter flight at approximately 1000’ AGL, the pilot saw a strange object that had symmetrical lines while under night vision goggles. The object was very far from the aircraft and moved quickly and flew over top of the helicopter while in flight. One of the crew members were able to take a picture of the object and were later informed by a friend on the ground in another location that they saw the same object and were able to get a video of it.",
"It looked like a Amtrak train at about 1500’ with lite up sections of different colors like a short cem trail at night lighted.  The object was at what seemed like the height were jets fly. There was no noise of an aircraft, moving at about the same speed as a jet. It was only the for about 2 minutes. It looked like a 20 car train with all sections lite with different colors. My 16 year old son came in the house and said the was a row of lights in the sky. I may a 59 year old power lineman for large utility and do have done executive security as a side job. It’s probably nothing but my brother is an Aviation mechanic and I sent him a picture and he has no clue.",
It was a silent string of lights gliding across the sky and disappeared after a minute after we started recording  We were grilling food in the backyard at approximately 6:15PM when we noticed a string of lights moving across the sky. It was silent but stayed in the same form of a line. After a minute it disappeared completely!!,
"Looked out window from highway and saw a line of lights  I looked out the window and saw a line of light in the sky. As we got closer it was several hundred feet or more in the air. The line was not one solid light but about 20 shaped lights in a straight line. Appeared to be letters but I couldn’t make out what they were. The lights did not blink or flicker or change. There was no movement. Once we passed the lights and I was looking back at them but still in close range, they disappeared from the right side to the left. I tried to video and photograph but the light wouldn’t pick up on my phones camera. My husband (driver) also saw the lights.",
"Metallic cylinder in sky, hovering still no sound or movement.  Was with my son in back yard, I looked up and noticed a very clear cylinder shaped object with looked like 5 white lights. I kept eyes on it and called my son to me, he was in a tree in yard shooting targets with bb gun. He came to me and asked ""what"" he could tell by tone of my voice it was something serious. I said ""what's that"" and pointed to object, he looked and his eyes got big, jaw dropped and said ""wtf is that"" I said something like I just wanted to make sure I was seeing what I was seeing. I asked him to tell me what he saw, to confirm to me what I was seeing. He said to hurry and take a picture, but didn't have phone on me and didn't want to miss at least seeing it for longer. After watching it for a minute, the object and a cloud next to it seemed to fade before our eyes not take off flying in any direction, which was also very weird. It was still light out and sky was perfectly clear and blue in area once object ""faded"" away, my son asked ""how did it do that"" like I would know. I been searching for a report of same thing before I said anything, when seen report from person in Elgin describing same thing but no lights I used that date, I know it was 1st week of Dec., was wanting to just confirm someone else's report. Being in a Chicago suburb and being very obvious in sky, I thought there would be many reports of this object. It had to be pretty big, there were a handful of planes that could be seen in both easterly and western sky and from my observation this cylinder was much bigger. Hopefully this helps someone else seeing same thing.....",
Saw a long trial of light moving along the sky from one place to another  Saw a long trail of light around a black cigar shaped object moving from west corner to east corner in the sky. It lasted for about 10-12mins then lost sight in the clouds.,
"Looking to the SW there was a very long straight string of bright white lights moving towards the N very quickly. I have footage.  Looking to the SW there was a very long straight string of bright white lights moving towards the N very quickly. They moved in a straight line as if following each other but the distance between them was uniform throughout, indicating it was one solid craft likely in the cigar shape. It was at least a foot ball field and a half to two foot ball fields in length and moved much faster than the earth is visually spinning. At first I thought it had to be a string of satellites sliding across the sky as the earth was spinning but then I realized they were moving diagonally and much faster than the planes in the immediate area. I recorded the lights until the began to dim at the front end one by one as if it was traveling behind something else in the sky obscuring my view of it. However, there wasn't even a single cloud that it could have hid behind after it disappeared. My footage isn't the best due to me being so baffled and watching it with my eyes rather than the camera.",
"Dog barked, I sighted object. It flew directly over me. Object long and slender, had lights, 100 yds long. .  Siting of UFO on 3 December at approximately 6:40 pm. Location, North Phoenix, at 12th street and Forest Hills.  I was walking my dog, then she barked at something in the air. To the southwest, I sighted what I first thought was a smoke trail of a fireball. It was “dusty” and long. I stared at it. As it got nearer it came into focus. It was very long, 100 yards or more, in a narrow rectangular shape. The entire thing flew almost directly over me. It had lights all along the body but not evenly spaced either horizontally or vertically. The front end had two lights. All the lights were white. The body was black and could not be seen. It then proceeded to the northeast and disappeared somewhat looking like the first observation. The entire incident lasted about 3-4 minutes. I was dumbfounded. I did not have my phone, or I would have taken a picture.",
"Line of lights lasted about 30 seconds, moving quickly at an angle  I was walking the dog in our community around 6:42 pm and as usual, was looking at the sky to see what constellations were visible. I saw a rigid formation of lights moving quickly at an angle before disappearing instantly. The sighting lasted about 20-30 seconds. No discernible sound was emitted.",
50 or more lights miles long in a line across the night sky. Lasted a couple minutes then disappeared from the head to tail systematica  My neighbor Jessie may have captured it on his phone.,
"Witness an enormously long cylindrical craft  Was out walking my dog in my apartment complex at approximately 6:30 pm on December 3, 2021 when I noticed a unbelievable long cylindrical craft with a long single row of lights or windows decently bright enough to light the body of the craft enough up to see it was a long continuous grey cylinder of unbelievable length. This is what really blew my mind. My best guess in length would be 3 to 4 miles in total length. 30 to 40 semi bright lights or windows in a single row. Lights/ windows did not go to end of either end. Ends were lightless or windowless about 5 window/ lights in length on each end. Each end was rounded like a medication capsule/pill. Direction was coming from the west going east towards the ocean that is about 50 miles away. Besides guess at altitude would be 10 to 15 thousand feet. Sighting started near my unit which has a pool and pool house adjacent to my unit. Object first appeared in the area of pool. I watched for 15 to 20 seconds as it was moving east. There was light from from apartment windows and light poles making it hard to focus in object. After 15 or 20 seconds I ran with dog in tow to a field by the complex that has power lines running the length of the field. There were no lights to here to pollute my vision. Once in the field i watch the craft for another 20 seconds, but in great clarity this time. I got my best look at craft in this location. This is when I could clearly see it was a solid craft. I watch it till out of view over some tall pines. Once out of view I tried running to another area to see I could see it some more but the object was gone. No sound was heard during the entire duration of sighting.",
"Saw 25 lights come in like a meteor shower & ended up horizontally and disappeared lasting 30 seconds & totally silent.  Observed what seemed to be a meteor shower coming from south to north. The 25 light “shower” ended up laying horizontally cruising as fast as a commercial aircraft and about as high, I believe. It cruised for nearly 30 seconds northward and simply disappeared. Holding my arms up, my hands would be 3 feet apart. That was the size, at least 20 commercial airplanes. The ufo was silent.",
"Long straight shining flying object  On 12/3/2021 at 6:40pm. It was already dark outside, I was walking my dog in my community. I love looking at stars while walking my dog in the evening. At that time, I was on the phone with my sister in China. Suddenly I saw a long shining bright chain-like object showed up in the middle of the sky and moving from west to east, and it flew away out of sight after 4 minutes. I took a picture with my phone, but the quality of the picture isn’t the best due to the capacity of my phone camera. My son said later he also saw the same flying object while he was out.",
"Saw 1 black triangle flying East at low altitude. It was dark out. Solid green lights on 2 front corners, red light on back corner.  I was driving south-west at night. There was an apartment building to my left and storage facility to my right. Above the storage facility were two green lights. They were east-bound, heading towards me. As they got closer, I could make out shape of a triangular craft, with the green lights situated on the two front corners. There was a triangular bevel under the body of the craft , which was nearly as dark as the sky. As it passed overhead, I made a U-turn in the driveway of the apartment complex to view the craft from behind. I could only see one red light, presumably the back corner of the triangular craft, heading east (towards downtown Kansas City).  The craft moved at a steady pace. I’m not sure of scale, but it seemed lower to the ground than an airplane or helicopter. It made no noise and left no trail. There was no one else on the road at the time. There was one car leaving the apartment complex as the craft exited my field of view.  I parked in the apartment complex and immediately tried to call my brother. The call dropped several times (at least 5). I could not reach him until I got home. I usually wouldn't have thought much of it, but decided to report that detail as technological disruptions sometimes accompany UAP sightings.  An illustration is attached.",
"I saw a long row of lights with a slight haze around them that appeared to have no wings or tail and flying in a non-typical fashion.  In early evening of Friday, Dec 3, 2021, around 6:25pm I was walking around the block on my usual two-mile walk. I reside in the Ashmoor subdivision located in the western portion in the city of Mobile, Al. The neighborhood I was in when I spotted the object in the sky is Westchester, which is adjacent to my neighborhood. It was already fully dark outside.  I had just left Ashmoor subdivision and entered the Westchester subdivision. My route takes me to Westchester Ln S in the direction of Grelot Rd. When I turned left onto Westchester Ln S off of Westchester Run, I immediately noticed a long glowing object to my West not far above the tree line that made me first think of a comet. As I continued to walk and focus on the object, I realized it was not as far away as I had first thought and was slowly moving to the northeast. My thoughts then shifted to this being a blimp. I then noticed that this object was flying in a very peculiar way.  I could see what were small individual lights in perfect formation forming what would be a long straight row of lights in a possible rectangle or disk shape with no apparent wings or tail. The strange thing was the way the object was maintaining its altitude, however, in the direction it was flying, the front of the row of lights were much lower than lights in what would be the rear of the object.  I then ruled this out as a blimp because there were no lights on top, front or rear of the object. It also appeared much too narrow to be a blimp. The object was also too long to be a helicopter. My last thought was ok, this has to be an airplane, however, there were no lights where there would normally be if the object had wings or a tail; there was only one long straight row of lights.  I quickly called home and had my wife and son go outside and look to their north. I stayed on the phone and asked them if they saw the object. They were only about 1 to 2 blocks away from my location. They both said they saw the object and I asked my son to also take a photo and a video if he had time. My son snapped the picture that you will see attached to the form. The photo I took did not come out clearly.  After I snapped my photo and my son confirmed he had taken one, I was going to take a video and I also asked him to video the object but in the few seconds we had been occupied snapping our photos, the object was gone. At the rate of speed it had been moving in the total time I had viewed it, over about 30 seconds I’m guessing, it still should have been visible before it flew over the tree line. It must have accelerated in the few seconds we were looking down to swipe from photo to video on our phones and when I looked up it was no longer anywhere to be seen.  The object can be found on the attached photo to the lower right of the bright planet or star in the center of the sky. The object is also almost straight above the bright streetlight you can see in front of the house straight ahead. The object was moving to the right as you look at the photo. As you can see the front of the object was pitched way down in comparison to the rear. The object remained pitched forward like this the whole time I viewed it, about 30 seconds, and it did not appear to be decreasing its altitude.",
"Loud Jet Noise, Round Red Lights flashed North to South, appeared 1 second later further west. Small White Object Went Toward It  I was jokingly flashing my flash light at a very bright star in the southwest sky at 6:35 pm. I was out looking for a rock to prop my apt building door. Approx 2 minutes after I flashed the star, I heard a loud jet noise above my head. (as loud as a jet taking off on the runway) I looked up and a round red light was above my head. I remember thinking I could fit through that hole and wondering if I was going to get beamed or a ray come out. I was scared. Out of the corner of my eye I saw several flashes of light going on and off to the south. Then the lights were gone and they reappeared approx 1-2 seconds later to the west. They were all red in color and flashed on and off one at at a time rapidly from north to south taking up the whole half of the sky to the south. The line of lights disappeared and reappeared 1-2 seconds later farther west. this repeated 10 times in total, until I could not see the lights flash across the sky. Also, not all of the 8-10 lights flashed on, some were only partially visible and the jet noise gradually decreased in loudness until I could not hear it at all toward the last 2 rows of flashing lights. The lights flashed to rapidly to count in a row and seemed to follow I-70 /CO 58 West to the mountains. I waited 2 seconds after the lights were gone and then saw a small white object in the west sky just above and to the right of where the lights disappeared. The small white object moved 45 degrees descending toward where I last saw the lights. I never saw a craft, a plane or a jet trail",
"Saw multiple lights very high in sky that moved together like a huge worm in the sky, then disappeared.  There were multiple lights that moved together like a school of fish but looked like a worm in the sky. It was much higher than planes. While we watched it moving across the sky it disappeared.",
"Straight line of multiple light moving very slowly northeast until vanished completely in two seconds.  Leaving parents on the Tennessee and Kentucky border at around 6:18 PM on 12-3-2021. My son was first one off porch and looked up and asked if it was Santa and his reindeer. When my mom looked up saying what the, so me and my father went to take a look, witnessing a straight line of multiple light moving at a slow rate of speed northeast in a horizontal position and as it was slowly moving a aircraft was moving towards it in a high rate of speed. The closer the aircraft got to the object the slower it went but moving into a vertical position, in which the light started going away from both end until completely gone in 2 sec. The whole experience lasted around 3 - 4 minutes. With the sky so clear there was nothing that the object could have got behind or any laser hitting clouds to reflect back the multiple light in a straight line. I tried recording with phone but it doesn't show up. There was also a aircraft moving towards subject in a high rate of speed. The closer the aircraft got, the more it was in horizontal position. Then once the aircraft looked like it was at the bottom of the light it completely vanished. The animals was going crazy and I felt like I had just ran a 5k run in three minutes and filling somewhat confused and drained. I would like to know if anyone else has reported of this phenomenon. I know it couldn't have been any kind of government communication system. Because unless cloud or something was in sky to reflect the lights back to me they would just be visible from the sky. Feel free to give me information on this or any other reports on this. Thank you",
"Trail of lights in the sky that appeared to be on a sideways rotating disc. Craft moved up in the sky and faded away.  I was biking home when I stopped to fix my jacket. I looked up and saw an unusual trail of lights in the sky. I assumed it was the iss, but it was long. A straight line of white dots. I looked more and saw an outline of an oval, looking like the side of a discus. I pulled out my phone to video it after I saw that it seemed to be rotating, the lights moving up like they were on the side of a rotating disc. As I videoed the scene, I saw the thing move higher in the sky. Then the lights started to fade and the outline disappeared as the whatever it was faded away into the night.",
"Took a phone picture out of window while driving on highway  Wife was driving home on interstate when we noticed the lights above our car approximately 1200 feet , I snapped a photo from my phone, when you zoom in the shape really stands out",
"Two separate people two separate locations  Observer 1 saw one large white lighted object first while driving home at night. Called second observer at home to have them go outside and look as well. Observer 2 while at home turned all lights off, went outside saw a plane in the sky. They continued to look for another object and then saw a very large long white lighted rectangular object in the sky while on the phone with observer 1 who was also seeing the same thing. Note both observers were about 3 mi apart from each other. The object was North, slightly NW. The lights appeared to be very tall and parallel to each other and they seemed to run the entire length of the object. While continuing to look at the object in the sky, observer 2 at home proceeded to take a picture with their cell phone and then a zoomed in picture with their cell phone. Observer 2 then moved the phone settings to video and the object disappeared. Observer 1 approximately 3 miles away also noted the object could no longer be seen in the sky at that time. Observer 1 saw the object for approximately a few minutes. The object did not appear to be moving. There were two commercial airplanes in the sky within sight during this time of the unidentified object sighting. Observer 1 is a mechanic and was in the army for ten years.

Straight line of lights in the sky that slowly started going out from right to left  I was driving down the road and looked up and there was a long line of lights underneath a star. It looked like 100 stars in a perfectly straight line and it just sat there. I thought it was maybe a plane or the streak from a plane that had come through or something like that but it was all lights. Then all of a sudden after about a minute it’s slowly starts disappearing from one end to the other. Like all the bulbs were going out or it turned or backed up and was flying away or something. I have video footage.,
"Long strip of lights and very quiet  At dark: One long strip of bright white lights moving in NE direction, very slowly. Quiet, no sound whatsoever. Rather low hanging, about 10k ft. Once picture was taken, the lights disappeared.  *The darker picture is the original. The lighter picture is lightened to see the detail.",
Set of about 15 round white lights moving together as if connected southwest to northeast.  Several of us watched set of round white globe shaped lights move as if connected across the sky in a straight line at exact same altitude. A couple of the lights appeared almost semi transparent on the sides. No sound audible. Altitude difficult to guess but each round light about size of car light if 3 blocks away. Lights did not sparkle more of a consistant glow. Group of lights stayed in consistant row next to each other as they moved at same height across the sky. A neighbor in the area watched too..and another couple down the street were looking up watching.,
"Nightly dog walk route  I walk my dog every night from 14th street and 5th Avenue to 16th street and Union Square West and usually take a photo of the Empire State Building for my zoom background for work. My firm is located in Overland Park, KS so my co-workers enjoy seeing the colors of this building as they change every night. I have seen similar craft on more than one occasion this was not my first time. My dog stopped when I did to take the photo but remained fixated toward the Empire State Building (18 blocks north of us and I had to pick him up and carry him home).",
Saw 3 UFOs hovering above - looked like they were playing games flying around each other amongst the three saucers,
"Cancer and Grey Beings  Ok, so this is my second encounter, I reached out to you with the first one and we spoke. The first one happened in Lexington when I was a child and I had the UFO right above me. This time I had 4 beings examining me.   On April 21st I was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on my sacrum. This encounter happened shortly after that. It's hard to talk about this because they were in my house, when I saw the UFO at least it was outside, I was scared then too, but this seems crazy. I don't know what to feel.   I woke up to see 4 beings, I couldn't move and my wrist and ankles felt like they were bound but there was nothing there visually. I was laying on my right said so my back was to a wall. There were 2 beings kneeling on my bed looking over my body at my back. One had a cylinder he was moving up and down my back, the second one seemed to be watching, like they were examining me. There was one standing close to my feet watching to 2 examining me. The one closest to me, saw me open my eyes. He nodded his head at me, then he touched one that was bent over me. He looked up and got off the bed. All 4 kind of nodded at me like they were saying it's ok. They then backed out of my room and faded into the darkness of my hallway and were gone. My body became free as the left.   I was scared and tried to get the lights on quickly but they were gone. They were short, maybe 4'5 - 5'0. They had a larger head but not like you see on movies. They were almost proportional. No hair, large eyes, small nose, small mouth, and no ears. Their bodies looked strong, like lean muscle. Their skin was a dark gray but when they were in the dark hall, there was a dark dark forest green tent as they faded away.   I had a hard time going back to sleep but, I got to thinking maybe they didn't mean to scare me, maybe they were just interested in the tumor. Maybe they were trying to help me or something. So with that I was able to relax a little. They didn't hurt me, it's just scary to wake up and find 4 beings in your bedroom. I don't know why I would have an encounter as a child and then have one at this point in life. Maybe they are just watching me. I just don't know what to think.   However, it got even stranger, I wasn't going to tell anyone what happened because I just thought it was so abnormal. You know why me. But my roommate that morning said ""Did you have someone in the house last night, Gwen (the dog) seemed to be really upset."" So, I broke down and told him what happened. He said he woke up for a moment and thought he saw a small person going towards my room  So, I don't know what was going on - but it is very very unbelievable. Have you ever had a report about an encounter with someone with cancer.",
It was just a light. Moved around seemed to zoom out of view and back in one or twice.  I was in the back seat of the car and looked out my window. It was their for 1-2 minutes seemed to move around a bit. There seemed to be a second one but I wasn’t able to get a picture of it.,
A bright colourful large object in Mississauga disappeared into a bright white ball of light  a couple of meters in the park close to my house i witnessed a colourful object flying low over the park. It was large and made a loud humming noise. i ran to the park as i lost sight of it only to find it was nowhere to be seen. i looked up in the night sky and saw a fleeting ball of light. It moved very fast and became as small as a pinhead of light as it disappeared.,
5-9 tightly grouped objects in a line  I was hanging out smoking a cigarette in my car with my wife. I started looking at the stars because I noticed that they were alot more vivid then usuall. I then noticed what looked like 5-9 smaller yet distinctly brighter what I thought were stars all in a straight line. I watched for a moment and noticed that they were moving in a diagonal yet straight line all at once. At which point I asked my wife if she noticed It to and she laughed but said she had. It started getting a little brighter and started shrinking and the was gone. I've seen plenty of satellites and government and civilian aircraft and nothing can bend the laws of physics and move like that. Which leads to the only rational option would be extra demential beings,
"Immense colorful shapeshifting Orb illuminating hovering in the sky.  After returning home from a long day of work, the sun had set. Being approximately 9:00pm PDT I arrived in my driveway. In accordance to a compass, my driveway faces the front of my house to the north, and the back of my house facing towards the south. My property being centered from street light illumination, allowed the 05/13/2021 clear night sky to appear even more crisp with clarity. As I left my vehicle, walking towards the east, my eyes trailing the night sky came to a violent holt. Frozen in my steps I paused. An object of great vibrant color changing illumination completely silent, hovering in one location to the north east in accordance to my house position.   30 minutes has passed, comparing the object to the east edge of my house, my reference point has not changed. Completely still in the same location the object has not changed position in reference to the edge of my house. As minutes passed, I watched the object display multiple patterns of bright polluting light. Giving off different shapes with each sequence of color change in random grouped order. The lights displayed pure radiant energy.   Completely amazed and in utter disbelief, I realize that the object is nothing I have ever witnessed in my entire life. After an hour of constant display, I left my reference point and rushed into my house. Frantically gathering my aunt and cousin. Rushing back to my reference point, the object has only changed its pulsing display of color.   Ruling out possible explanations of the object being a plane, helicopter, and or drone. Two hours has passed and the objects stillness questions who revolves around who. My aunt and cousin speechless with confusion. All I want is a closer look. My aunt leaves to return with a pair of binoculars. Winding the focus lense my jaw drops. Centered in my view the object forced vibrant light in split seconds. Red flash, elongated speckled light triangle, green flash, speckled hexagon diamond, blue flash, assortment of speckled lines, white flash, solid speckled perimeter, yellow flash, center and trip to tip. The arrangement has no pattern but a sequence of shapes and mixed colors.   The object hasn’t alone. Passing off the pair of binoculars hand by hand, the dazzling shapes and colors was the beginning. In split seconds the color arrangement seized to only a white center orb with a perimeter of white sequenced dots. In this seize of color, four small pin point objects arranged outward from the Initial object and disappeared in all directions. Coming up on 3 hours of the objects fixed position, the color display begins again only in completely different arrangements. Passing from the west to the east, a raising humb of an airplanes engine crosses paths with the object. Reviling the sheer size and blinding illumination compared to the plane’s signal lights. The altitude of the object is unknown but obvious to sit higher then the planes flight path.   It has been 3 hours and the objects position begins to change. Seemingly to roll across the sky, the object appears flat, in a slow sweep right to left the object is gone from view 3 hours has passed and it is now 12:00am. The Dazzling color show so quick to end only leaves the dark absence of night in its untouched position.",

"two lights circling in a figure 8  Two lights were circling in the shape of a figure 8. They would intersect at the top the 8, at the mid point of the 8, and at the bottom of the 8; in synchronization. This continued for 15-20 minutes and was witnessed and/or filmed by 5 family members. While we were going in and out of the house to get phones to take video or check social media for reports from others, the lights disappeared. We were also checking other websites to see what aircraft or military planes were overhead and found nothing. There was no sound, or wind during the sighting or other aircraft lights. The sky was overcast and the lights appeared to come from above the clouds as there were no beams of light shining up from the ground, and appeared over a wooded area right across from our home. There were no other neighbors out and no reports of anything on social media. We were going to call the non emergency number for the police but thought the lights would be gone by the time they got! here and they would think we were all crazy.",
"My daughter and I were sitting on our beach house back deck when we saw two yellow lights over the ocean in the southern sky. The lights disappeared after 5 seconds. Then there were at least 7-10 bright white quickly flashing lights in the eastern sky for about 10 seconds and they disappeared. They were not airplanes. The lights were too fast, only white and too close together. About 5 minutes later we saw one yellow light again and then it disappeared and the second yellow light appeared and disappeared. Again, we saw the white flashing lights again. This happened 4 more times with 5 minute breaks between each time.   There was a light yellow haze around the yellow lights we saw. I tried to use my phone camera to capture what we saw but it wouldn’t pick up the lights.",
"Bright gold ball low in the sky in a perfect straight line going east  I took my dog out to go potty. When I opened the door there was a huge perfect bright gold ball like object. It was very low, almost like just above the tree lines on the other Mesa to the north.  It moved very slow and in a perfect straight line. No blinking lights or any kind of movement. Just slowly moving in straight line from West to the East. I moved further outside to watch it and it slowly moved in that perfect straight line and then poof and it was gone. My dog was being weird and waits for me to call her in but when she was done she ran into the house. And in the morning she refused to go outside at 6:00 am her normal time for 10+ yrs. later today she keeps barking towards the same area. There is now why it was a satalite satellite cuz it was so low and so big. Very strange and no noise either. Of course I did not bring my phone with cuz it was so early",
"A white cigar shaped craft stationary and flashing in the sky.  Today at around 9:30 AM, I spotted an odd flying thing that was white and kind of cigar shaped in the sky. There were no visible clouds or planes in the area. I was riding on the interstate a little ways before Lincoln, Georgia when I saw it. The object was just sitting there in the sky stationary, and a little light showed up beside it that looked like a star.  The light and object disappeared almost as soon as I saw them. I looked all around in the sky, but they had vanished. I waited a few minutes, continuing to look up at the sky. Then I saw the object again, but there was no light beside it. The object had been on my right side and was now in front of me in the sky.  This time it flashed slowly like a light twice. After it did that I was gone for good. I continued to look up in the sky and didn’t see anything again.",
"Two lights moving in sync.  Friday May 14th at roughly 4:17 am I stepped outside my backdoor to take out one of my dogs. I instantly looked up as I always have for the past few years as I love sky watching. I noticed there seem to be more stars out than usually which I thought was odd. As I was trying to focus on the stars, I noticed 2 of them were moving in sync. I held up my index finger and the distance between the 2 lights was from the tip of my finger to my knuckle area. The lights looked like stars. No flashing. They were moving North west. There was no sound. It was 3 degrees celsius outside. Wind at 7km/hN, 10km/h, ceiling 9100m, visibility 23 km, humidity 70%, sunrise 6:30am. Because of the tree in my backyard I couldn’t see where it went. The time lasted less than a couple minutes.",
"Ball shaped uap over northeast Houston in broad daylight.  My mother and I were sitting outside enjoying a beautiful day. It was pleasant for Texas and partially cloudy so we got to take advantage of my lounge chairs that lean all the way back. Since we had some clouds you could see very clearly into the sky because there wasn't blinding sunlight. It was around 2 in the afternoon. I watch the flight paths of planes coming into Bush International Airport regularly and enjoy monitoring jets, birds, whatever. I had been watching the birds when a black object caught my eye. It was moving in a straight line (unlike birds). It was also too high for birds. Just skirting the low lying cloud bottoms. It appeared to be round and black. No wings. No contrails (wasn't high enough for that anyway). It almost looked like a black basketball but considering how high it was, it had to be decent sized. Someone would have to do the math but I guess it would be the size of a smart car? It was moving at a good clip but not blinding spee! d. It slowed for a second and then returned to full speed. Very straight perfect line. I alerted my Mom and started to point and that's about the time it disappeared behind some branches on our magnolia. She sorta laughed thinking I was being silly. I went inside to get a cup of coffee. When I came back out my mom was standing and staring in the direction I originally saw the ball. She said ""You aren't going to believe this but I just saw it."" Same situation, it had just disappeared in that same area going southeast towards Lake Houston and the Eastgate/Huffman area. It seemed to be coming at regular intervals and sticking with the same heading, speed and altitude. I have no way of knowing if it was the same object or three different ones. It came along one more time, we both saw it and I grabbed my cell phone but couldn't get it on the viewfinder. Shortly after the last sighting a Chinook looking military helicopter flew by at 2:23. I did get that on video. It fl! ew right over our street and was heading south. It was not a b! ird. It had no wings. It didn't make any sound that we could hear. It was in broad daylight and the sun was slightly behind us. We were not blinded and had a perfect view.",
"Shape shifting object that shimmered and or produced white yellow lights in different spots.  Object flying at high altitude, about as high as airliner, was seen by 4 witnesses flying or floating over Houston County, GA from 1838 (approx. overhead) to 1855 (when it could no longer be seen on horizon).  Seen on 5/14/2021.  Object traveled in a southeast bound trajectory.  Object seemed to shift change, flash lights, and or shimmer irregularly.  Shimmer or lights were silver, white, or yellow.  Object was moving much slower than an aircraft, did not emitt any detectable sound.  I took video of object, sketched at time of viewing, and took notes.  Object may be high altitude silver balloon, or ballon group, however object seemed to be too high to be ordinary party balloons. An aircraft was seen in the vicinity of balloon at approximate altitude as baloon. My estimate is that it must have been at well over 18Kft.",
"I was outside my HUD apartment at Pioneer Park Apartments and watched the western sky and checked the flight radar about 9:30 pm Friday may 14 2021 and scanned the aircraft band on my aircraft radio nothing but total silence strange rf interference to my  ham radio 2 meters and 440 radio .and nothing was on the radar and there was no noise, the possibility an LEO satellite but I was bright white light looked like circle shape like flying at speed of aircraft  It was a clear night in May 14 2021. I saw a bright white “star-like” thing in the sky. It was moving. I was looking west of Ironwood. I was in the North Hills. The bright light did not twinkle, as most stars seemed to do, but then it started to become  brighter, approx 3-4 times larger and much brighter, still  moving.",
Cigar shaped craft seen northwest of Eugene at 9:30pm on May 14th  Sorry for not following the directions and using a word processor......                            While walking we observed a long cigar shaped craft to the northwest of Eugene. We watched it slowly move in a manner unlike any plane or balloon. It was grayish yet illuminated in such a way that seemed translucent We watched it for 10 minutes . We agreed that it was not a balloon and had no wings and it was silent .We tried to use our phones to record it but the lighting made it unviewable except for a blurry long light.I have always been a skeptic of UFOs but now im seeking more data to understand what it was we all saw. There was no propulsion system as it seemed to be using some other type of flight capability beside the conventional type...,
"I was going to the bathroom and looking out the window that faces north west (I’m guessing the direction.) I saw a very bright light in the sky that looked really odd. At first I thought it was a piece of a satellite because there were reports that pieces of a Chinese satellite were coming back down to Earth earlier that week. I must have stared at the shape for a solid minute just trying to figure out what it was. It wasn’t moving or getting bigger. But it was a large white spot of light that could be described as a hole or break in the sky. I started to get really freaked out and called to my husband, frankly, thinking we were going to die (still assuming it was a piece of the satellite). He was putting our children to bed and did not come immediately. At this point the bright light took a different shape and I stopped calling for him. The aircraft came into view at this point. The light I saw was a reflection of our sun setting. And the ship was mirroring the sunset colors (although not a true mirror image, just the coloring of the sky). Track lights around the aircraft then became visible next and as those became visible the aircraft left- so quickly that it left streaks of light or it’s shape behind. It was at this point my husband came into the bathroom. I was trying to stay calm but explain where the silhouette was. He didn’t see it, although saw a bit of light, but cannot confirm what I saw. I thought the silhouette stayed for a good minute but it did fade rather quickly. The aircraft made no noises at all. It was actually incredibly quiet- I couldn’t hear the wind, water (we were across from the ocean), or birds. It was hovering in one spot, and the color were the pinks, blues, and purples of our sky- but it had a metallic look to it. The shape is difficult to describe because I honestly haven’t seen a shape like it, and more frankly, I’ve tried to forget this moment as much as I can. There was a movie from my childhood, flight of the navigator. The closest shape and color I can give is that- except there were no grooves or bumps, just a solid shape and smooth. I’ve never seen anything like this before or after. I’ve waited years because frankly, I feel insane telling anyone. I’ve had no breaks from reality before or since. I honestly want to forget this ever happened, but there is a lot coming out in the news and my husband and stepfather are urging me to report it. I have no pictures or proof.",
White orb floating over national guard base  Camp atterbury Indiana May 14 2021  A white orb floated over me and seemed to take its time to where it was going you can clearly see a plane in the distance in a Side by side comparison I had my truck on so you can hear the background noise but when it was over me it was completely silent and made no dramatic turns just stayed straight there were no satellites in the area accordingly to my satellite apps camp atterbury is a national guard base supposedly these sighting happen all the time out here I just happened to be getting off work,
"Many lights over North Myrtle Beach ocean moving erratically  Last night while watching comedy on Netflix, I observed an orange light flash outside my beachfront condo. When it did it again I got up and got my binoculars and my iPhone to take a picture.  I could see many lights out over the ocean but thru the binoculars I can see that some of them are moving very erratically and changing color equally as fast.  I took a picture and when you enlarge the photo you can see one of the lights is a red color and looks to have energy coming from it.  The ufos stayed there for more than 40 mins.",
Orb in the sky looked like a turning ball of light. It went back and forth and closer and then farther away. I recorded it with my cellphone and noticed that when it came closer it seemed to interfere with my cellphone making a weird static sound (which I didn’t hear with my ears at time of filming) and then the sound and orb just disappeared.,
As I was closing the local bar alone. I looked up to the north and saw a subtle shiny object. It was shaped like a blimp or cigar. It appeared to be about 300 ft. high and stayed on a steady path from west to east at a relatively slow pace.,
"Silent red orange orb  Red orange orb around 25,000 ft coming from the north,  sped up and turned towards the east and kept going .   The object didn't have navigation lights and emitted zero sound , it stayed the same color the entire time and maintained the same elevation and speed. In the video I tried to signal it with a strobe flashlight,  no response.   Flight radar screen shot showed no aircraft in the area .",
"Spotted UFO from close distance while jogging on beach  I spotted an UFO from a fairly close distance while jogging on the beach in the morning. It was huge and lasted only few seconds like around 10 seconds and went away high up and was no longer visible due to cloudy sky. It was in silver color and has silverish hue around it, i didn't see any lights on it. I looked around to see if anyone else had seen it but there was only one fisher man around at that time that i passed minutes ago and was too far away from me that he is barely visible, i dont know whether he noticed it or not, he was gone when i turned around and jogged towards him. It didn't make any sound at all. I'm a 17 year college student. My cellphone signal which used to be very good at that location got completely absent for a minute at that time. When i went there the following day, there were few dead fish and other small sea creatures at that spot.",

Silent very fast moving disc shape before daylight lot up the disc as I seen clearly and what looked like two smaller ones exiting it  I was walking my dog as I do every hour. I'm always looking at the stars  on an early morning just before daylight I seen a big disc shape with a triangle shape piece in back that was looking as a piece of the disc was missing. It crossed the sky very fast high as the stars and as it passed two other. Star looking moving and crossing paths an disappeared as I could see and the disc went as far as I could see  I returned home and I was certain I was not outside that long but hours passed  did anyone else see this,
Animated looking green glowing flying saucer,
10 to 15 lights moving slowly over my beach house in a moving group.  It was late in the evening but still light out. From my front deck I looked up at the sky and saw 10 to 15 lights or maybe orbs. The sky was mostly clear with a light blue background. I live on the beach and was shocked to see all of those lights together but each was one was slowly moving on its own and all were coming over my house heading SW in like a group. I watched them slowly move SW maybe towards Portland.  I am 78 years old and and they sure got my attention!,
about 15 orange circular objects flying at low altitude.  On 5/15/2021 at Approx. 2015 my wife at I spotted about 15 orange circular objects flying at a low altitude from East to West just off of Route 73. There was very little wind and the crafts made no sounds. We were able to recorded 9 of the crafts when my wife started the video. The video last about 2 minutes,
"11 glowing orange disc flew silently across the sky. They had no visible way of propulsion and looked like bright circles.  We were sitting in living room and looking outside. One of us point out the first orange object, wondering what it was. It had no flashing lights to indicate that it was a plane and had no a single sound. It flew at a medium pace from W to NE. It was at a low altitude. After it flew out of view we noticed that there were two more following it,coming from the same direction it originated from. They glowed orange and looked like a ball but when one of them turned out their glow we noticed it was actually shaped like a disc or saucer. Many more passed going in the same direction, not changing speed and in total we counted about 11. We thought of all possibilities but could not think of any technology that was open/known to man that could move like this. It was low, had NO sound at all and had no beacons to indicate that they needed to be seen by other aircrafts. It’s a Saturday night in Brooklyn so if people are on their roof it should be seen by other civilian! s.",
"Orange pulsating lights in a square formation to a straight line formation  I have video of the objects.  I was in the living room watching TV with my grandsons when my cat came running into my living room from the outside dog door. She kept looking around the corner to see if something followed her inside.  I went to see what she was scared of thinking it was another cat. I turned on my porch light and scanned my backyard.  I saw a plane coming in from the southeast which is not their normal flight for landing at our airport. For some reason I looked in the southeast and saw orange pulsating lights in a square formation. I yelled at my grandsons to bring me my phone he was standing next to me with his. I then saw them go into a triangle formation then into a straight line. I then Started recording all the while trying to get my roommate outside to see what was going on. One by one they changed formation and then seemed to disappear, then when they had all but gone a larger red pulsating object came up over the trees.  It kept ascen! ding up until it disappeared.",
Brilliant orange cylinder with points of white. Appeared translucent and had a deliberate flight path  Hello.  On Saturday May 15 at approximately 9:30 PM local time an object was observed moving West to East at several thousand feet. The object was brilliant orange with points of white and mostly cylinder in shape. It was traveling in a straight line and I didn’t hear any sound though the person I was visiting who I called outside to see it said she heard a motor. The object passed just to our north and then turned to a southeast heading. I contacted the Highbridge police department and no unusual sightings were reported. The local airport in Pittstown also stated there were no illuminated aircraft in the area    Duration was only five minutes.  The brilliant orange light remained as it disappeared below the distant tree line.,
"Dull yellow light spotted, 50ft above us  My fiancee and I were star gazing on a pretty clear night, and my lady said what is that light?, I turned the direction she was looking up, and next to a large maple tree, we see this Dull yellow colored light on, a Tic Tac Shaped UFO, around 40ft long, 10ft wide, with a dark grey cloud surrounding the craft, and my lady said what is that, I knew exactly what we witnessed that night, this craft did not have any sound, and moved slowly over us, it was behind a bushy tree in a minute or less. She tried to record a video on our phone, but it would not work?",
"Unpacking for camp we all see large cylinder 200 yards long with 6 lights on it moving slow and making no sound 400 to 500 yards away  We started unpacking camp after dark. Wife says she hears something that sounds like people walking around in the woods across the road 45 feet or so away. We are standing by our truck and it’s off. I then hear it too. I explain this is most likely a dear and if it’s a predictor I have bear spray and a side arm. I tell her we are fine just keep your flash light on while I start a camp fire and finish unpacking. I move to the back of the truck bed. Kids are standing at the front of the truck with their mom. I see light out of the corner of my eye. I look. I don’t say anything. Wife says do you see that. I say yes. Kids say what. Then they see it too. No one points, it’s extremely obvious. We are at a remote camp site, no other campers or light. They all ask is that a spaceship. I say yup sure looks like it. 200 yards across 400 to 500 yards away above the tree line, moving at a very slow speed making no sound. Ambient light reflecting off of some kind of dark metallic material and large lights running down the middle from one side to the other. Maybe 6 lights. Wife said kids get in truck, they were scared. She said do you have your phone and I said I’m not wasting my time looking for my phone cause I’ll miss this. It moved very slow and further away until it disappeared under the tree line. This lasted for maybe 10 minutes. Wife wanted to leave but I said we are fine. We continued to set up camp which takes like 30 minutes and for some reason it was 2 am when I got done. We got to the site a little before 9 pm. Thought that was really weird and can’t explain it. Wife is 35 I’m 36, kids are 14, 9, 7, and 3. We camp a lot. I tell my kids that it’s likely there are things we can’t explain but we don’t see things like this. We decided not to talk about it and told the kids not to share it with people, it’s just cool that we know this is real. Wife is an educated management professional and I’m self employed as a general contractor. I’ve grown up around military aircraft and spent all my life in the woods. The camp site is on a mountain side, so we had an elevated vantage point for most of our field of view.",
"Large (at least 500 yards long) cigar shaped object with two rows of approx 100 windows. Light metallic brown color. Issued blue light.  I was 4 years old.  Playing in front yard of home.  I became aware of the object when I was kneeling on the front lawn on all fours when I became aware that the green grass was blue in color.  As soon as I became aware that the grass was blue and was puzzled about it, it suddenly switched to green.  It was then I realized I could move and I stood up and felt a presence behind me.  I turned and looked up above the trees and saw the large object.  It had approx a double row of 100 windows and was light brown metallic color.  It was moving slowly west.  I felt fear and turned to run into the house.  But then it dawned on me I had just been there and the ""people"" were friendly. I turned back, smiled and waved.  I stood there and watched the object move slowly west for about 3 minutes.  I then ran into the house and tried to communicate to my mother what I had just seen.  She went outside but the craft had already passed over and did not return.  She could not understand what I was trying to tell her.  She then asked if I wanted lunch (that is why I place the time around 11 AM). I remembered at the moment the ""people"" who looked like those whose picture was on the front of Communion though with less pointy chins as depicted on that cover.  I later recalled ""flashes"" or moments of actually being on the craft.  In junior high school I would draw/doodle pics of the large eyed, large headed persons.  It is difficult even now to think of them as aliens or anything other than persons or people.  It was a totally positive experience. Later, I was in Army Intelligence as Chief, Intelligence Branch, Military Intelligence Division, G2.  During the USS PUEBLO incident I participated in decisions about the use of nuclear weapons against North Korea (Jan68).  I experienced an intense Deja Vu and there was a sense of dread that ""the last time through"" we had made the wrong decision and used nukes vs NK.  I made recommendations not use them in a memo that had 5 items against and 3 items for their use. After the memo had b! een acce pted by, sent in CINC, UNC name unchanged, I experienced a recall of craft seen at 4 years old and the feeling that was why had the ""contact.""  That the purpose of that ""contact"" had been fulfilled with my recommending not using the nuke weapons but instead advocating for negotiations and setting an example for other countries to keep the peace.  The first point of the memo was the stated United Nations Command mission was to ""keep the peace."" The second point was negotiated to get the crew back unharmed and set an example for other countries to follow in such crises. I can recall the entire memo but it was classified: TOP SECRET, NOFORN, LIMDIS, EYES ONLY  on the rest of the items in the memo.  But there was the intense feeling that the purpose of the contact had been fulfilled with decision not to use nuclear weapons in response to the seizure of the USS PUEBLO.  I have only told a very few persons about this for obvious reasons.  But it is as clear to me today was it was then.  At the time my IQ was measured at 155 and I had a photographic memory with respect to reading intellligence reports.  The naming of the position I held as Chief, Intelligence Branch identifies me to those who have access to the information of who filled that position during the PUEBLO crisis.  I am a bit uncomfortable about that but the experience of 1949 is clear in my mind.  I have researched for sightings of such an object as I saw: cigar shaped with double row of windows and light brown metallic color and huge:  as a 4 year old I can only try to guess at the true size of the object.  But I estimate at least 500 yard long (in my mind 5 football fields) or larger.  At one point I found a list of sightings in a book which indicated a large cigar shaped object in summer of 1949 near South Bend, Indiana which is approx 30 miles from the New Troy, Michigan location.  It confirmed my experience.  I would be interested in knowing if there were any other sightings during 1949 of such a large object in the midwest.",
"UFO spotted over Long Island ~1930's.  This was found in a box of photographs that I inherited after my grandfather passed away. I do not know exactly what to think of it, as there were no notes attached with it. I estimated the time because he lived near Long Island in the 1930's and was an avid photographer before becoming a WWII photoj-ournalist. I thought that the people here would be able to make more sense of it than I was able to. It is very bizzare and I would like to know more.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.

"Flew in sky fast and made sky hazy and wiped away  I saw it fly in the sky above the lake. I rolled the window down to get a better look. It made the sky fuzzy like looking above a candle.   When i looked back to tell my mom, of course, she didn't beleve me. But when i looked back, it wiped across the sky and left.   Later i felt drowzy and my head HURT VERY BADLY at 12:00 noon. Now im ok.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",
"Terrified  I have two skylights I was laying on my couch watching TV and on one skylight lights flashed and there was one red light  among white lights and I thought that maybe it was from across the street because there is an apartment building where all people live but I thought why would it be flashing on my ceiling and then a shadow flew through so I watched two the second skylight and it flew off ... I have a memory, but because I’m so afraid that people will think I’m crazy, my memory I think is distorted but I know there were four lights and there were lights on top and it was more of a diamond shape and it glide it off it didn’t go off like an airplane and it was too close to the ground to be an airplane and I heard no helicopter  sounds and there are no zones of airplanes and we do not have an airplane flight but it was the first skylight  The cut my attention because I couldn’t understand why all these lights were flashing and why there was a shadow crossing a pass... so I waited like three seconds and looked in the second window and it was taking off ascending",

I was looking at the air traffic when I saw coming over my right shoulder a triangle black craft moving very, very fast.  It headed towards USA.  I woundered why it did not break the sound barrier.

"I was about 13 when I was laying down in a field looking at the partly cloudy sky. It was a windy day when the some of the cloud seperated and I saw a large cylinder.  It was a summer day in 1972 a year before my father past-away. I was 13 years old. That summer day I was playing in a field near my home on Landsford Rd 3 miles south of Marshville, NC. I then layed down and looking at the clouds, they were low lying clouds and it was a windy day when some of the cloud broke up an I saw a cylinder that was white or silver and had 2 black ring around it ( It was silver, black, silver, black, silver) I got up from laying down asd look back up in the sky and it was gone. I thought I was just seeing thing but It seems so real and even after 26 years I still think about that day. I have watch a lot of documentary on UFO but never seen anything like what I saw. Do you have any sighting of a black and white cylinder.",
"Stumbled upon a UFO  When I was 10 years old I went with my brother and a bunch of friends on a hike up to a sign on a hill in South Aberdeen, Wa.  After we reached the sign we decided to go up a little higher behind it.    When we reached the top I recall looking up quickly and catching something in my vision by a tree.  I remember being highly frightened and knew what I had seen I shouldn't have.  I can't really recall what I saw but I remember making eye contact for just a moment and I seem to recall some type of craft within my vision.    I really believe that we happened upon a UFO that was hidden behind that sign.  Then suddenly we all were standing in a different spot and were lost.    We wandered around the forest for the rest of the afternoon, we were all really scared and finally found our way out.  I recall that when we did find the road we all seemed extremely frantic to get to it.  A friend of mine dropped his walkie talkie that fell into some logs but we didn't stop to try and get it.    I have a scar on my left shoulder that I don't have any recollection of how I got it.  My brother and I have only spoken of it once and his recollection seems even foggier than mine.  As for the friends we had never spoken of it and I don't have contact with them any more.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

a shape like a cross with a circle in the middle flew over my house at a low altitude  I saw a shape that looked like a cross fly at low levals over my house when I went out side to play with my dog this shape had a wire or something like it joining all the points of the cross and inside the cross was a circle when it past my house it seemed to take of into outer space at high speeds.

"Round small yellow saucer idled in/above the water behind us, with a second small object hovering over my girlfriends shoulder.  The UFO was small to the point where we had not noticed it while we were taking maternity photos at the park, next to the lake.  We only had noticed it when we were going through our photos when we got home.  We printed Polaroids of them form the phone, and that’s when we noticed the object docked in the water, but what was strange was that there was a second small guy hovering over my girlfriends shoulder while we were posing for the photo too.  We recently moved to Mount Arlington, not knowing the history of the area from when it was established ground up.  The history behind our area of living  is very scary and it’s raised a lot of awareness to us and it’s causing us to have to move for the safety of our family.",
Summary : About 100 feet from the ground. Hovered silently about thirty feet to the left .  The most overwhelming sight  was the speed in which it took off and disapeared into the horizon.  It was  a very clear and sunny day.,
I have not reported this to anyone yet so your the first. looking out of my patio i saw 8 silver dots moving in formation across the night sky no sound no trail  i watched for a minute or so and went to get some others when i returned they were gone end of story  refer to the above,
I have been having sightings for 3 weeks now and also BEINGS in and around  my.property with evidence of them co.ing into contact with myself I have photos,
"object was bright, not natural, IT was not a planet or star, or weather balloon. I HAVE PHOTO's!  broad bright cloudless day.  Object appered in sky about 5,000 ft, judging by line of sight Object was stationary in the sky for 3 hours.  We were sitting in chairs barbecuing when we noticed a bright reflective light in the sky. So I immedaitly grabbed my camera, took 24 exposures of object. While taking film the object changed shape, It did this while we were looking at it, and I have photos of it doing this.  Very strange, felt no fear, made me very uncomfortable. I don't know what it was, but if anyone else was in the area I hope that they can confirm my sighting. If anyone is interested in my photos I can be reached at ((e-address deleted))t",
Object was bright lit and changed shapes.  I work in the patch and I was in my rig when I looked up into the night sky and saw a glowing object.  It wasn't that far up in the sky it was actually pretty close.    As I watched this object it started to change shapes.  I watched it also move in unexplained directions.   I took my iPhone out and started taking pictures as the object changed shapes.   I have about 8 close pictures of it and I will send a couple in this form.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)),
"Long silver object, no noise or sound, floating  Across the road from my house is an old junk yard where old cars are mashed and taken away well this day I saw a long silver thing floating about five feet off the ground and there was no noise or sounds at all,I heard some people coming out of the old store and I glanced at them when I looked back the silver thing had left in a flash and still no noise, It could be seen far away to the north several miles away.  Have not seen any thing like this since  ((NUFORC Note:  No date provided by witness.  PD))",
"watched a silver craft over central London  A harrier jump jet was sent to investigate it moved of but returned sooner after it disappea  I do not remember the date but it was the day before Gerry Adams the leader of Sien Fein went to collect their parliamentary priviledges as members of the British parliament.    I had an overwhelming urge to go to Covent Garden which was unusual as I try to avoid tourists places.  My partner and I took our daughter and her friend to the swimming pool and went off for a drink at the opera terrace.  It was a bright clear day with not a cloud in the sky. My partner went to get the drinks and I sat at a table.   Looking up, I saw a silver disc in the sky. I couldn't tell you how far away it was or what size it was as I had nothing to compare it with. The waitress came to clear the table and I said to her 'Look at that,' pointing at the craft. She said it looked fantastic but took no further interest.   I spoke to the people on the next table and they said it was great but when I suggested it was a ufo they turned their backs and didn't want to know.    I showed it to my partner and we watched it for a while.   Passenger aeroplanes passed by without it moving but then it went away. A light silver plane flew over and when it had gone the craft reappeared.  We watched it until it disappeared again and a Harrier jump jet flew over rather slowly. When it passed the craft returned. It was almost a spiritual experience. Every so often clouds of luminous substance I presume were ionic bursts of blue and orange were emitted from the craft. It was a truly amazing sight looking down on the streets with all the people walking by, bulders high up on construction sites and nobody aware of the craft. A heliuum filled balloon escaped and flew off in a different direction. It was as though all this was happening to remove all doubt that it could only be a craft. We had to collect our daughter and I said to her and her friend do you want to see a ufo and they laughed thinking I was having a joke.  Walking back through Covent Garden I saw some one with a camera and asked him to take a picture but he could not speak English ! and I di dn't pursue the matter. We watched the craft until about 7.00pm. It did the most amazing thinks, appearing and disappearing instanly it was like blinking. Then a sort of brown cloud appeared around it and it disappeared and then returned. Eventually I had to take the children home.  This happened a few years ago but it is very much in my memory. I have a degree in analytical chemistry and was wearing a new set of contact lenses.  As a child I had many dreams of being abducted by aliens. One vivid one was of flashing lights at my bedroom window. I lived in a large house overlooking Elswick Park in NEwcastle upon Tyne England. In this dream I was the only person left. The aliens had everyone I knew and many other people I don't know where but I was aware of being the only one conscious. I also had dreams of beings in my bedroom thsat were so frighteneing that I would have to sleep with the light on and would always get into trouble for it but the trouble was never worse than the fear. Playing in the park one day I noticed a lump under my skin on my knee cap. I could mmove it around under the skin. It is not there now and I have not had it removed.  There is more things in my life but can be interpreted in rational terms so I will not go into them here. I have often wondered about hypnotic regression to see if it would reveal more of my dreams but am unsure about the technique. After seeing the craft I looked into ufo's and alien abduction so my mind may be contaminated with this information. I am still unsure whether to be contacted by an investigator but I assure that what I have written is true and would testify to it in a court of law or on anything that I hold dear.  Thank you.

"Contact what extra terrestrial beings .  It was a normal afternoon about 1:30pm, I didn’t go to work that day so I stayed home and babysit my son.  He was about 3 months, newborn. he was in his crib and I was in my bed laying down I woke up to the ceiling of my body elevating up towards the ceiling I grabbed on to the mattress and a blanket and I slowly descending back down to my bed I looked through bedroom window and I saw something  that wasn’t normal or should be over my bed I went to the kitchen to get a better look.  The kitchen windows were a lot larger than bedroom window, as I look to the right side of the window I noticed there was something that looks like craft over my bedroom roof it seems to be hovering sitting on top of the roof and as I look in the distance, two other crafts identical to the one that was over  I became very concerned about it and I turned around go back into the room to get my son as I turned around and I looked towards living room, there standing was 5 foot brownish pale looking being standing looking at me in surprise, big long arms  in a styling/standing  position.  It was breathing kinda heavily seemed as if was under some type of stress but I felt the feeling of comfort there was no harm done to me or to It, I felt at peace with my self and the  situation I also told him that I think they’re out there waiting for you . I spoke those words and it never replied it just kept staring at me.  It had an object in its right hand that looked like some type of shades or sunglasses very thin about half an inch or an inch with length is about a foot or less at 11 inches I was kind of in an fully stretched open position my eyes became attached to it and became curious never said anything, it noticed  that I was interested in what he had in his hand and he gave it to me, he just put his hand out and give it to me.  I mediately knew where it went I put it on my eyes and it seems to disappear into my face as I looked around the entire apartment everything seems crystal clear I was amazed at what I was seeig half round side everywhere as I did that disappeared and I saw him again in dreams, dreams that I’ve had a whole bunch of dreams of different  locations in the aircraft in rooms that look like refrigerators steaming  cold air,  places with weird looking trees very dark also very high mountains that they live inside the mountains but very beautiful inside, some other type of being showing me around, weird looking animals birds and other types of beings  how were very family and didn’t attempt to cause harm to me .",
"Sometime around noon between spring and summer of 83-84, I was 4 to 5 years old and saw a disk shaped object flying fast across the sky from west to east (aprox.). I was swinging on a swing set with a friend of mine and happened to look up to see a U.F.O. flying low enough so that I could see the windows or what looked like windows anyway on the sides of the ship. I wanted to tell my friend to look, but new that it was travling to fast and by the time I would have told her it would have been gone. So, I said nothing. It's possable she saw it too i guess, but I was to young to think about it at the time. I also had no idea what aliens and Ufos were other than as a creation of hollywood, just like the terminator. I know this for fact because a year or two later when I saw some show on Ufos I remember than telling my brother for the first time what it was that I had seen. He was the first person I told.",
"A late July or August weekday afternoon between 01:30 p.m. and 04:00 p.m.: Leaving no contrail and at an altitude twice to thrice the cruise altitude of commercial jets, a moving object (about the size of what a bright planet looks like in the night-time sky) was seen approximately 60 degrees up from the western horizon. Traveling in a straight line from west to east at a rate of speed approximate to that of a jet, the object was a-glow from white light reflecting up from the earth below.  Two or three other objects, similar in appearance yet smaller in size and more difficult to see, were then observed trailing the larger object as it reached a 90-degree zenith point in the sky.  Spread out at random distances up to a total of about a 40-degree arc, each object caught up with the larger object and flew around the sides and rear of the larger object in honeybee-to-hive fashion.  Each smaller object, one at a time, disappeared into the back of the larger object. The larger object, picking up speed, kept moving in a straight line towards the east.  At about 55 degrees up from the eastern horizon, developing thunderhead clouds obscured the object from view and it could no longer be seen.

"I was standing outside and i saw an object flying it didnt look normal. Everytime the object came near us lightnig struck and another appeared it happened more then once.The lights were different colors yellow, red, blue and a greenish shade. They came REALLY close like where you could reach out and touch it for 1 or 2 seconds then made a formation of about 5 with a large one in the front.",
"6 white bright saucers flying high, no sound in a triangle formation at great speeds  Six white or bright saucers flew over my yard high up in the sky in a ""V-like"" formation in afternoon daylight.

"Saturn shape wobbling and spinning on central axis with 2 orbs zipping back and forth and around it with movements like hummingbirds.  Victorville, CA While relaxing on back porch with my dog here in Victorville on a hot, day with blue skies, except for sporatic cumulus heads, I saw silvery disk wobbling and relatively stationary to reference point (my roof tiles). CLouds moving from SW to NE, but object and relatively  smaller round and white orbs zipping around the main disk. Main disk shimmered from the side and when it turned on its side you could see an inscribed dark inner circle. I had rand into the house and got a pair of 9X25 (5.6degrees) Nikon binoculars. The objects were not affected by the winds above which moved the sporatic clouds at pretty fast speeds. After some time, seeing how it appeared to be intent on staying around awhile I went to find a camera, but only my Nikon 35mm had film and this has no telephoto lens. However, upon blowing up the objects in Photoshop you can see the Saturn shape and its companion which resembles the ""X"" shape of those craft that Luke Skywalker flew in the final battle in the movie Star Wars. THese ""Xs"" seemed to have emitted from the craft, but I could be wrong. THey were hard to see and seemed to leave some kind of visual blur (not a contrail, but could be mistaken for one). I am a college educated professional of 38 years of age, who majored in geological engineering and my wife is a geologist too. I am an amateur astonomer with 10"" Newtonian and 8"" C-8 with computer and am familiar with the local sky. Often we see strange craft coming out of Edwards AFB nearby. Incidentally, the craft would have been just south of the Edwards AFB southern boundary. I can send a map to anyone interested. I am not mistaking this sighting for conventional or any kind of typical experimental aircraft. I am an aviation buff and have done consulting work for leading pioneering contractors in military aerospace. One more thing. I could see jetliners passing nearby and clearly below these objects. So I estimate that if the cumulus clouds peaked at 55,000 feet that the object was somewhere above this, maybe at 75,000 feet. Therefore, the main object must have been much larger than large airliner and the smaller orbs about the size of the airliner. Keep in mind I viewed with binoculars. I have 30 hours in flight training and my wife is a private pilot. I am sending you the photos by e-mail attachment. That e-mail will read ""VictorilleUFOs"" as will the attachments.",
"Craft followed us down the road then dissappeared almost as if it were watching us..  i remember almost like it were yesterday, after getting out of school one day my friend  and iwere going back to my house to get a change of clothes, we decided to take meriman to michigan ave. when turning left onto meriman from annapolis she notice something that looked almost as if it were a plane over the field... probably about half as far up as a plane usually goes 2 fly.. and i mean this was broad daylight.. it looked like a plane but as we looked at it it was creeping across the sky. slower then a plane usually goes, there were no lights no airpressure from the rear of it, cause at first we thought it was a plane, then we thought it was a jet, but you know how jets leave those white trails behind them? well this one didn't leave one.. i don't know if there are planes that look  or r like that... after that it disappeared when we turned onto michigan ave.. but i would like 2 know if i was just seeing things or if i really seen a UFO... i beleive they r out there ...

"2:00PM Green ball of light that was about the size of a softball 15 ft above highway that passed us at a couple hundred miles an hour.  A friend of mine,his wife and I were driving NW at 34th Street on Route 290 (NW Freeway) in Houston about 2:00pm in the afternoon. It was a bright sunny day. We were driving in medium traffic on the six lane highway (3 each way)  when a bright glowing green ball of light flew past our van and continued along above the highway at about fifteen feet above the roadway. When it got to the overpass down the road from it, it continued to follow the conture of the road staying the same height above the road. We could see it continue on past the ""hump"" of the overpass (actually we could not see it go down the back side of the hump) but it continued on and came back into view and continued out of sight. The driver and myself saw this object as about the size of a softball. As it passed the van we were in it was no more  than a few feet from the side of the van. I was on my knees bwtween the two front seats. The drivers wife however, said the green ball seemed to be about the size of a basketball and about fifty feet  off the road. The lady driving the car that was beside us waved here arms franticly at us pointing, like, ""did you see that?"" We nodded yes and kept driving. It seemed to be going a couple hundred miles an hour. it was gone in a few seconds. The green ball was very bright, glowing emerald green light, quite visable in the bright sunny day.
